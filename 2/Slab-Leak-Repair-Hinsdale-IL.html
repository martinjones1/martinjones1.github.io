<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Mixing vaporized salt with rock salt is not suggested, as this could clog the softening tank. It is recommended that you enable your unit to go empty of one type of salt prior to including another to prevent the occurrence of any problems. In any case, when you're preparing a water heater replacement, play it safe. If you need a license, call your local department of inspections and ask. And make sure a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
