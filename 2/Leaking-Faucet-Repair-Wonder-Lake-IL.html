This can be difficult, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is very important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be used to assure the line is correctly flushed.</p>
<p>The simplest way to keep you and your household safe from the potential dangers of backflow through cross connections is to not develop cross connections in the very first place. Nevertheless, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, pool, water function or other kind of cross connection, have actually an authorized backflow prevention assembly installed.</p>

This can force the potable water to reverse its instructions of flow through the cross-connection between the two systems. Potential contaminants can then enter the drinkable water supply. The best method to minimize build-up is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year.
