<p>Aside from these two important parts, there are a myriad of little, maybe less vital things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain.
