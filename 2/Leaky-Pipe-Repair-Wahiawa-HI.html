<p>When deciding on the proper system protection there are numerous considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation must be taken a look at on a specific basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems consists of the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire defense system are developed to match the hazard that exists in the places they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be really various, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be designed and set up to fulfill that particular hazard or need. An airplane hangar will need a very different fire security system than the system needed in an apartment. The backflow defense requirements for these two examples would also differ greatly.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the needed instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. If permitted to re-enter the water system, there is capacity for the polluted water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for efficiency, as well as checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
