<p>The most efficient way to address hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

An approved, correctly installed and maintained backflow assembly essentially eliminates the danger of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Ensure that the softener is filled with salt or potassium chloride following the producer's recommendations.</p>
