Guarantee the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cord when you link the electrical wiring harness to the disposer.</p>
<p>Plumbing is a vital part of your home or business, and its ability to function is vital. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains clogging, this could be a sign of a bigger issue, like a tree root intrusion or a large clog. If the drains clog occasionally but you can generally flush them out, this may be a smaller clog like a buildup of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap scum from the bathroom. Little blockages can develop into huge ones fairly quickly.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
