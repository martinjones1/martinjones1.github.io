<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were really responsive and timely to send me a bid which was really competitive. They were really professional and did a remarkable job. I would definitely call them once again for my plumbing requires. Now, if this staining just appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust probably exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still a problem that needs to be handled right now (you'll likely need a brand-new hot water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
