<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Per Hour Whiteville NC</h3>
<p>Root Intrusion: Root invasion describes what occurs when tree roots start to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This happens since the wetness in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots ultimately do piece your drain lines, they can cause obstructions, breaks, and back-ups which may result in extensive property damage. Look out for damp, green patches in your backyard, a consistent sewage odor in or around your home, an uptick in rodent and insect activity, and sluggish drains, as these are all common indications of root invasion.</p>
<p>To identify if your home is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it goes into the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is attached to completion of the water pipe. Make sure you check both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
