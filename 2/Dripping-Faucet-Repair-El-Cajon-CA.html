<p>In water circulation systems, water is usually kept at a significant pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might fail or be reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might enable infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is common in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
