Local building codes for instance will require a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air gap between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any possible siphon before it can happen, avoiding polluting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more sophisticated and complex backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical gadgets set up to avoid backflow variety from the reasonably basic to the complex and very sophisticated.</p>
