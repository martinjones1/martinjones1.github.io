A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in specific houses, it also avoids wastewater in private homes from receding out and polluting the public water supply.</p>

Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
