A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in private houses, it also prevents wastewater in personal homes from receding out and polluting the general public water supply.</p>
<p>If there is backflow at your house, you could infect your drinking water with non-treated water from an irrigation canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it. Likewise, if you utilize your hose to fill a wading pool or hot tub, a turnaround of the water circulation might siphon swimming pool or health spa chemicals back through the garden hose and into your house's plumbing.</p>

<p>Plumbing is the practice, fixtures and materials used in the installation, maintenance, extension, and alteration of all piping, fixtures, plumbing appliances, and plumbing appurtenances in connection with hygienic drainage or storm drainage centers; venting systems and private or public water system systems, within or adjacent to any building or structure.</p>
<p>The drains in the typical home get consistent usage. Hair, food scraps, soap scum, and other particles can slowly build up over time.

In either case, scalding water threatens and ought to be instantly dealt with by a skilled plumbing professional.</p>
