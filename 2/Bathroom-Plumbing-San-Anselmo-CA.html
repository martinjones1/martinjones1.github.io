<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring.

Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
