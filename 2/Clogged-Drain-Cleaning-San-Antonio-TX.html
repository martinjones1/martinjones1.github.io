Repeating leaks and repairs. If your water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run.

Unseen sets of pipes utilize pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet.
