<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
