<p>Once, the gas pipe comes up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, but should then shift to galvanized. I am not sure why that need to be. It is also enabled to utilize black iron if it is most likely covered with a galvanized finish (which is basically a special paint"). PG&E frequently does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>
<p>Read your insurance coverage policy thoroughly if your polybutylene pipes have actually stopped working. Make certain you know what is covered and what is not covered. Many insurance companies will not cover a slow leak. Claims might be denied due to the fact that the basic HO-3 homeowners' policy specifically omits "a loss as the result of a water leak over an extended period of time." Call your insurance coverage agent and verify your coverage. As soon as you have actually gone through your policy and verified what is covered and what is not covered, check with your agent to verify that your understanding is right.</p>
