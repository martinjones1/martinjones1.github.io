<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>The toilet takes a truly long time to flush. Here's how it works: During normal operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves-- described as the zone of minimized pressure-- is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is developed to discharge and open water to the outdoors, making sure backflow never ever occurs.</p>
