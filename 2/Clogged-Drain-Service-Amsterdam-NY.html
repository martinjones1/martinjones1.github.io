<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
