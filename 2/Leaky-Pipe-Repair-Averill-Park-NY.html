<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Averill Park NY</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities needs that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer might be required to be found on the water service line, within the building, or both locations. After an initial inspection and testing of a newly installed backflow preventer, the water consumer is needed to have the backflow preventer tested on an annual basis.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, permitting air to get in the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
