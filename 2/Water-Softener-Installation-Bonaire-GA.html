<p>The next action we should carry out in the repair process, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have cleaned up the body, and the repaired components are still out of the body, and we have finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be difficult, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system needs to be used to guarantee the line is correctly flushed.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
