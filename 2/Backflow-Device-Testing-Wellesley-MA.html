<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains substantial amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a problem-- for its lots of intended usages around your house.</p>
<p>Water firmness is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the distinction on your skin is because soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum. This results in the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean.
