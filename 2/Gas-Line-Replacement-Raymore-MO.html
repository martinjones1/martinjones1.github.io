The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely used in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and channels, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
