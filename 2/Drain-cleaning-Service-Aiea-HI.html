<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the building; extra, more significant expenses can happen if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for locals. A PE or RA can help determine if installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss.</p>
