<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a severe public health hazard if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of illness or disease.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can take place when there is an unexpected reduction in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as throughout fire fighting or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This turnaround can develop a suction result and draw potential impurities into the safe and clean (drinking) water supply. Tank water heaters are commonly discovered in the majority of homes. Their parts are an insulated tank, normally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water till it's needed.

While these prevail indications that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily imply repiping is the only service.
