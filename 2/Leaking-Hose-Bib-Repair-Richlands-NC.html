<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, however how do they work and which styles are best for certain applications? Typically the type and installation requirements are spelled out by ecological guidelines and local statutes. Local building regulations for example will require a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air space in between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any potential siphon before it can happen, preventing contaminating water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more advanced and complicated backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices set up to prevent backflow range from the relatively easy to the really sophisticated and complex.</p>
