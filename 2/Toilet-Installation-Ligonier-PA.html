<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Ligonier PA</h3>
<p>Most of the times, the toilet can be fixed instead of replaced, since the concern often comes down to a single element or 2. Sometimes, however, the damage is so comprehensive that you either need to replace the entire toilet, or the cost of repairs is so large that replacement is merely a more practical alternative. This normally includes cracks in the toilet bowl itself, widespread corrosion over numerous parts, or just due to the fact that you 'd like to replace your existing toilet with something more visually pleasing.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
