It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air must be eliminated from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from crucial locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will collect.</p>
