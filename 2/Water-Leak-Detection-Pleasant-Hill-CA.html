When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. There is potential for the infected water to become a health risk if enabled to return to the water supply.
