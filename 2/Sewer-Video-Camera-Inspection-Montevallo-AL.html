Prolonged service warranty: The majority of disposals include at least a 1-year service warranty, however if you buy one with a life time guarantee (15+ years), it will most likely be more expensive. While there's not a specific timetable regarding when you should repipe your house, you need to definitely check out repiping if they have not been done in 50 years or more-- especially if you live in an older home built closer to the turn of the last century.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers bring only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close.
