When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. If allowed to return to the water system, there is capacity for the infected water to become a health risk.
