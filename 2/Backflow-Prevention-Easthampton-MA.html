For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that accelerate deterioration Likewise, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of deterioration control.
