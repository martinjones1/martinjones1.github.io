<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks at Seneca Falls NY?</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
