<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual preference. An authorization is not required for repairs which involve just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages supplied modifications are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A normal water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, large brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a close-by drain or drywell.</p>
<p>Plumbing is a crucial part of your home or business, and its ability to function is vital. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains clogging, this could be an indication of a larger issue, like a tree root invasion or a large clog. If the drains clog occasionally but you can generally flush them out, this might be a smaller clog like an accumulation of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap scum from the bathroom. Little clogs can turn into huge ones fairly rapidly.</p>

You will want to install the softener in a dry, level place, like a basement or garage. It will need to be close to the water's main line, an electric outlet to turn on the system, and a drain for the salt water solution from the regrowth cycle.</p>
