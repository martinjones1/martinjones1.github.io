Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.
