Deterioration can actually eat a metal away triggering the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or modify the tolerances triggering parts to not operate in a backflow preventer. The impact of deterioration on a metal alloy need to be assessed to identify if the part is functional or should be changed.</p>
<p>If you  wish to get rid of the salt, just fill the salt water tank with potassium chloride pellets, not salt pellets.
