<p>When the information gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has actually deteriorated in its performance below the established minimum standard, backflow preventers need to only be fixed. The test procedure is a diagnostic assessment of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum basic, the backflow preventer need to be fixed or if necessary, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working requirements. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
