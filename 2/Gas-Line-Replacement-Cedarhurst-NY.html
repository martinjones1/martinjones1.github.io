<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>

For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed.

Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
