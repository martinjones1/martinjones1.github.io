<p>Secure your house from leakages. Call Doug's today at (985) 222-2913 or contact us online to get more information about toilet repair and replacement in New Orleans. Transporting occurs when the inbound difficult water follows a narrow path through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened. If you have actually ever seen that the busier your service is, the much better your cleaning agent works, the perpetrator might be an oversized softener.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- typically sodium. The result is water that's been successfully softened by removing nearly all traces of the minerals that make up hard water.</p>
