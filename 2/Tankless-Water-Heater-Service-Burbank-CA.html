Small clogs can turn into big ones fairly rapidly.</p>

<p>Insert the flange on the top side of the sink, and connect the attachment system on the underside (Image 1). It is practical to apply pressure on the flange from above using a second set of hands or a heavy things. This will keep the flange in place while connecting the attaching system below. Ensure the plumber's putty is noticeably oozing beyond the edge of the flange all around (Image 2). Eliminate the excess putty with a rag once a total seal has formed.</p>
