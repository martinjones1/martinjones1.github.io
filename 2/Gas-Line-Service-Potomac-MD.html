<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
