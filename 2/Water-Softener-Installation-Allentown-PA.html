<h3>When Hiring A Plumber, Always Confirm The Price And Warranty Allentown PA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leakages occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been found to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these concerns.</p>
