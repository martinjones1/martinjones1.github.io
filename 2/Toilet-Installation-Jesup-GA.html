Plus, since those device can have a longer life with soft water, you won't need to replace them as soon.</p>
<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to get rid of the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and lots of other minerals carry positive charges, so water softeners utilize salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you water with drinkable water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, drinkable and watering, you are likewise needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
