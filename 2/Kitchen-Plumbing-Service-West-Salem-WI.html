<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies West Salem WI</h3>
<p>Root Invasion: Root intrusion describes what occurs when tree roots begin to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This happens because the wetness in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots ultimately do piece your drain lines, they can trigger obstructions, breaks, and back-ups which may result in extensive property damage. Watch out for damp, green patches in your yard, a consistent sewage odor in or around your home, an uptick in rodent and insect activity, and slow drains, as these are all common signs of root intrusion.</p>
<p>Energy Performance. Picking a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star score is recommended. The energy effectiveness of a storage water heater is shown by its Energy Factor (EF). The more effective the water heater the greater the EF score. However, just because a water heater has a greater EF worth, it doesn't always suggest it will have lower operating expense. You also need to think about the fuel source.</p>
