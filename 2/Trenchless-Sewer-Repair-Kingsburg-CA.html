<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Kingsburg CA</h3>
<p>This is particularly common after returning from a holiday or not using your home's supply of water for an extended period of time. If this occurs just when your hot water is running, it might be due to a rusty warm water heater and not the plumbing pipes in your home. We have a devoted group of knowledgeable, highly-skilled, and professional plumbers who are at the helm of fixing all kinds of sinks.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were very responsive and timely to send me a quote which was really competitive. They were really professional and did an incredible job. I would absolutely call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration only appears when warm water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is obviously still a problem that needs to be dealt with right now (you'll likely need a new water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
