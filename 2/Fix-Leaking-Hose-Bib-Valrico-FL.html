When your water lines are repiped, it simply implies old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement.

If you do have regular leaks, we find that repiping can in fact be the more affordable and much better long-term option.</p>
