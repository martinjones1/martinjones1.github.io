<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then leave into the sewer or septic system from your house. When you experience obstructions in multiple drains at once in your house, then that typically indicates that your main sewer line is backing up. This can take place in multiple places and any mix of drains. For instance, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from numerous drain lines in your home.</p>
<p>You reside in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to wear away and burst when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
