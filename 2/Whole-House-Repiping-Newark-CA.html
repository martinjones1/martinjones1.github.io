You might have to look into utilizing a high pressure water supply to remove the clog. This process is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. There are two basic piping materials utilized by plumbing experts. PEX and copper both use many advantages and benefits such as eliminating the metal taste from your water.</p>
