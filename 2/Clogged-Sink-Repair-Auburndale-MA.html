<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow direction within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal circulation in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Often a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the issue if this is the case. You may need to check out using a high pressure water system to eliminate the clog. This process is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the intensity of the clog.
