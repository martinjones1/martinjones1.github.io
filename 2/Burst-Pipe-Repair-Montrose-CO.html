<p>A waste disposal unit must not leak. It usually indicates wear and tear which is a fair sign that its time is up when this occurs. Leakages can be unhygienic and will also ultimately cause strain on other parts of your garbage disposal if you think about what you put down the disposal.

For a leak in the drain pipe, you may have to fill the sink with water before analyzing the pipe underneath.</p>
