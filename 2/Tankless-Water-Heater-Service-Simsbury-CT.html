<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the needed instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. If allowed to return to the water system, there is potential for the infected water to end up being a health threat. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, as well as checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
