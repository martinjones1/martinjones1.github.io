While water overuse is a concern for your wallet, it's likewise a problem for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can consume to 25 gallons of water every day for their regeneration process. That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to remove the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals carry positive charges, so water softeners use salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with drinkable water, you are needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, potable and watering, you are likewise needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

<p>When compared to gas models, electric models are easier and less costly to install as electricity is already readily available through the main power supply line. For gas hot water heater, a particular gas line needs to be installed and a feasible source of gas developed. Another function of an electric water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas designs need to be aerated properly using vents and ducts in order to operate properly. With electric models, you will not have to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical substance that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water instead of developing on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they remain in one place for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the buildup could still occur.</p>
