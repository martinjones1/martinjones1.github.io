<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Longs SC</h3>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Unfortunately, main line obstructions are not something a homeowner can fix. This type of clog needs a professional plumber or drain technician to use a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are geared up with this type of camera to identify and repair the drain problem. If you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is specifically beneficial in finding an issue.</p>
<p>1. Install a hair-stopper - Hair-stoppers work just as their name suggests. They stop long hair from entering and blocking your shower drain. Typically, our Torrance drain cleaning experts are contacted to clean a shower drain that wouldn't need cleaning if there were a hair-stopper set up. Gas leaks can damage residential or commercial property and owners wind up paying high gas leak repair costs. This can be prevented by conducting annual inspections of the gas lines to keep your house safe. Property owners should speak with local authorities to confirm whether there are authorizations and inspections fees that should be paid before beginning the repairs.</p>
