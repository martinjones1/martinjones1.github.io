<p>Many sink concerns are repairable. If a sink is properly taken care of, it can last for years and might only need replacement once a kitchen is refurbished. However, some circumstances require a sink to be changed. Cosmetic damage is acceptable if it does not impede the performance of a sink. However, damage such as deep fractures might require a sink replacement.</p>

Those dissolved solids can cause a flaky accumulation on whatever from meals, to pipes, to the heating elements of your devices, to your own body.

<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest dual flush HET offered by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.
