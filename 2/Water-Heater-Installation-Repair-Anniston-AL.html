<p>After showing up after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but claimed they wouldn't take obligation if it leaked now because of some undefined oddities in how my sink was put together. After they gave me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, considering that I never ever wish to see this company again.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the cause of the issue.

Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
