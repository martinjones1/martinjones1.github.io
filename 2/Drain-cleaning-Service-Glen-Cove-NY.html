The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly used in the USA throughout the 20th century.
