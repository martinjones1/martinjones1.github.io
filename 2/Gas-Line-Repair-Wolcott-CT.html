When chemicals are added to a fire protection system supplied by a potable water supply, increased security is likewise needed.

Hanging on a pipeline might trigger it to come loose or break, releasing gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter should be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is easily accessible in an emergency.</p>
