<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Tulsa OK</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>Obligation for installation falls upon the owner of the co-op or the home or condo board. Owners and boards of structures that are issued an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer must submit plans with the DEP within thirty days. If the DEP has not gotten accreditation from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being set up within that time, a Notice of Infraction will be sent out. Violators will be liable for a civil charge of up to $1,000 issued by the Environmental protection Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can ultimately result in civil and criminal actions and proceedings, along with the termination of water service to the structure.</p>
