Repeating leaks and repairs.

<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your home.

Salt is typically used in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
