While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite an annoyance-- for its lots of designated usages around your home.</p>

It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test cocks. A PVB may be used to separate health or non-health dangers but is effective against back-siphonage only.</p>
