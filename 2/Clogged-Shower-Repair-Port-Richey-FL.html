<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of major surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it just indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing frequent and major leakages, you could be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can actually be the less expensive and better long-term solution if you do have frequent leakages.</p>
<p>By replacing the worn away and rusted galvanized metal pipe with brand-new copper pipes, your house will have cleaner and better-tasting water. Repiping also guarantees that water pressure is higher. Something to think about is the energy-efficiency ranking of various water heaters. A greater score indicates much better energy-efficiency and a lower operating cost. The quality of the water heater and the installation will affect the rate of your brand-new warm water heater.</p>
<p>With drain line cleaning, you understand your pipes are sparkly clean. With repairs, you know they're in good shape. And with lining, you understand they'll be safe and secure for years to come. As a homeowner or company owner, those reassurances can be really, very great to hear. We service pipelines throughout the state of Georgia, from Atlanta to Athens, Savannah to Augusta, Macon to Marietta, GA, and beyond.</p>
