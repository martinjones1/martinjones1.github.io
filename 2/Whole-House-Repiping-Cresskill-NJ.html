<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain.
