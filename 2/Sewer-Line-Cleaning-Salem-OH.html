<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains considerable quantities of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite an annoyance-- for its many intended usages around your house.</p>
