<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a regular event, but it does occur more frequently than you think! Often it happens in the evening when you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building projects quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding communities.</p>

<p>Home redesigning or house restorations are the ideal time to replace your house's pipes. However, if your home is constructed on a raised foundation then changing the pipes can also be done with minimal damage. Houses developed on a slab structure can take advantage of having their pipes replaced though the amount of drywall patching and painting is typically higher.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and identify the reason for the problem. The line was clearly degrading; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
