<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, however how do they work and which styles are best for certain applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are spelled out by environmental regulations and local statutes. Local building codes for example will need a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air gap in between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any possible siphon before it can happen, preventing infecting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more advanced and complex backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices installed to avoid backflow variety from the reasonably simple to the complex and extremely sophisticated.</p>

<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>To identify if your house is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Frequently, it goes into the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is attached to the end of the water pipe. Make sure you check both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe enters the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
