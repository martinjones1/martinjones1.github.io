<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct impact on your security, benefit, convenience, and dependability than your plumbing system. This is incredibly important! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to push the waste out of your drain system. Present policies restrict the quantity of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles piling up in cast iron drain lines. We provide two types of water treatment systems for tough water: Benefit Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
