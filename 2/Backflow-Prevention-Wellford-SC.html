For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

In the beginning, these small deposits are safe, however gradually they develop and ultimately clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically restrict the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
