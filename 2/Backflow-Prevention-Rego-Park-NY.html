<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Rego Park NY</h3>
<p>The most effective way to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, permitting air to bring back and go into the valve pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
