<p>Obvious odor. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the backyard, basement, or anywhere in your house or service location, provide us a call. That smell might be coming from your sewer system, which needs repair work right now. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that removes sewage from your house, launches sewer gas, and regulates air pressure in the waste-system pipes has stopped working, it will often need to be replaced instead of fixed. You'll understand this if your pipes are gurgling or giving off nasty smells.</p>

It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test cocks.
