If your water heater is past its normal lifespan (usually anywhere from 8 to 10 years or longer if you have a tankless hot water heater) or if it has a significant leak or extensive rust, it might be time to think about replacement.</p>

<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
