<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
