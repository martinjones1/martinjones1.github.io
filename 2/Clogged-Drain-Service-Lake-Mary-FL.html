That's not quite salt, however for those on a stringent sodium-free diet it may be excessive. If this doesn't work, you may need to replace one of your toilet's elements, typically the flapper. There may also be a concern with the chain attached to the flapper or the float ball. A plumber can easily replace these parts.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a full repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>

<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that eliminates hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.

Scale builds up in your pipes, obstructing them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale considerably reduces the lifespan of devices like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice machines. Tough water damages hot water devices. The higher the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will strengthen and harden into strong deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
