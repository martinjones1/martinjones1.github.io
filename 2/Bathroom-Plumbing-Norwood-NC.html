<p>Usually, there are storage tank water heaters that utilize either gas or electrical power for their fuel. Gas storage tank systems use practically 50% less energy, costing less to operate, than the electrical variety. Nevertheless, they cost a bit more than electric models. They also feature a temperature level and pressure-release valve that opens when either temperature level or pressure exceeds preset levels. We provide gas water heater service, in addition to electrical water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Shore.</p>

<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The current dual flush HET provided by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.

Correct care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
