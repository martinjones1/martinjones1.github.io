The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers individual preference not necessity. However, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
<p>Softeners mainly eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are typically referred to as 'firmness minerals'.
