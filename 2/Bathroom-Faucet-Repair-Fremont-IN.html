<p>Electric water heaters have a much shorter life expectancy than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capability. Still, the difference is not enough to make any substantial changes in the savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater may last 8-15 years, the electric choice will last about 8-12 years. Our CareSoft Series ® is versatile, providing a range of water softening solutions perfectly suited for your needs.

Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
