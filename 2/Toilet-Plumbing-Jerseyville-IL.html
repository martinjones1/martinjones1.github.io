<p>The toilet takes an actually long time to flush.

If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is designed to open and release water to the outdoors, guaranteeing backflow never ever takes place.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is a sudden decrease in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as throughout fire combating or when a water main breaks. At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This turnaround can create a suction effect and draw potential pollutants into the safe and clean (drinking) water system.
