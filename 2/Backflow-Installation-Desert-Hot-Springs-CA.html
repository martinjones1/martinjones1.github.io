<p>Aside from water trickling and the occasional creak, your pipes should not be making any odd sounds, specifically not ones loud enough to keep you up during the night. If your pipes are rattling, clanking, banging or making other obnoxious noises, that's a proven indication of a larger issue. Have your pipes inspected as quickly as possible so you don't end up with a significant leak.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the first most obvious indications of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic issue such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a bigger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent severe damage to your home. Even if the problem stems with the local system, it's still smart to bring in the specialists to limit the damage to your house.</p>
