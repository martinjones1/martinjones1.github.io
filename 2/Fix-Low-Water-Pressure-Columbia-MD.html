<p>If there is backflow at your home, you could pollute your drinking water with non-treated water from a watering canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it. Also, if you utilize your hose to fill a wading swimming pool or hot tub, a turnaround of the water flow might siphon pool or health club chemicals back through the garden hose and into your home's plumbing.</p>
<h3>Shower Installation in Columbia Maryland</h2>
<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical flow direction within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical circulation in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

Keep in mind, if you can't get rid of a drain clog after a few efforts on your own, offer us a call to assist, and we can get it done without permanently damaging your components and pipes.

<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are altering the economics of water softening in the carwash industry. Traditionally, the cost savings have actually been based mainly on minimizing chemical and cleaning agent expenses. While those savings are still considerable, new commercial softening technology using multi-tank systems (MTS) also offers significant water and salt cost savings.</p>
