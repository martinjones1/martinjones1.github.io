<p>When the drinkable supply piping is linked to a system or component which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may happen. Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not effectively safeguarded, non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system.</p>
<p>Having your plumbing repiped can conserve you money and time as well as safeguard your health in the future. After softening a large amount of difficult water, the exchange medium ends up being coated with calcium and magnesium ions. The exchange medium need to be recharged or regrowed (Figure 1)when this occurs.
