<p>During regular operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of decreased pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is created to open and release water to the outside.

For this reason, the RPZ should be installed in areas that are exempt to water damage and permit appropriate drainage.</p>
