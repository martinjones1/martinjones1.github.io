<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the needed direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. There is capacity for the infected water to become a health hazard if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, along with checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
