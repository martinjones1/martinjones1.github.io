Zurn Wilkins plumbing products that fall within this classification have actually been designated lead-free," meaning they are certified.</p>
<p>In local water system systems, water is typically maintained at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to flow to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your home or business. When the pressure drops for some reason such as may take place when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to fight a fire or a water main breaks or some other circumstance takes place, polluted water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an occurrence, there needs to be some kind of backflow prevention method utilized. The best and best kind of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the component). The proper backflow prevention device is required if an air space is not possible. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Epa and your water provider.</p>
