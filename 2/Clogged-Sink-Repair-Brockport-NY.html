<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
