<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular incident, however it does occur regularly than you think! When you do not see the water was off for a few minutes, often it takes place at night. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction projects quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
