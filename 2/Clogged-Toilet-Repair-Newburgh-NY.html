<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Cost Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were really responsive and prompt to send me a quote which was really competitive. They were very professional and did a remarkable task. I would definitely call them once again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration only appears when hot water is being used, then the rust most likely exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still an issue that needs to be dealt with right now (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) however not one that requires repiping.</p>
