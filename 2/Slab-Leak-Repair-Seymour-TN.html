<p>Spotty meals? Distribution pipes transition to even smaller sized private service pipes, bring water to specific houses, house businesses, shops and buildings. Depending upon demand, these pipes vary in size from a half inch in size to 6 inches. Water enters the consumer facility via a water meter that tapes flow rates and water utilization for billing purposes.

<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to eliminate the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and numerous other minerals carry favorable charges, so water softeners use sodium ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you water with safe and clean water, you are needed to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, drinkable and irrigation, you are also required to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

<p>For the most part, the toilet can be fixed instead of replaced, since the problem typically comes down to a single element or 2.
