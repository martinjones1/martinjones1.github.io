A license is not needed for repairs which involve only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages supplied alterations are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A common water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, wide salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a close-by drain or drywell.</p>

<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
