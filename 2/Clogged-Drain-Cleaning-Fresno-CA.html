<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing process includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some disposer systems do not come with a power cable connected. Get rid of the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1) if this is the case. Make sure to buy a wiring kit with the appropriate power score and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). When you connect the electrical wiring harness to the disposer, make sure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cable.</p>
