<h3>Necessary Services That A Good Plumbing Service Can Provide Colonial Heights VA</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause thousands of dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel way off schedule. So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers manage all types of work. Their duties break out into two classifications: Plumbers who handle fundamental repairs (often in emergency situations), and plumbers who focus on redesigning projects and additions.</p>
