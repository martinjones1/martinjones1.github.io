Possibilities are that your house might need extensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can function at optimal rates if your home was developed years prior to that.</p>

<p>Regular leakages: Leakages originating from your hot water heater are never a great indication. It is likely more cost-effective to replace the entire unit if your water heater has regular leaks or is constantly needing repairs.

Its sole job is to avoid drinking water from being contaminated due to backflow.</p>
<p>Drain pipe is not protected using the required solvent cement (end of the pipe should be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not actually glued in the regular sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is actually a solvent that melts the surfaces of the pipe and fitting for a few seconds.
