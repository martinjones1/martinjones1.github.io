They were extremely responsive and timely to send me a quote which was very competitive. They were really professional and did a remarkable job. I would certainly call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this staining just appears when hot water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is obviously still a problem that needs to be dealt with right away (you'll likely need a brand-new water heater) however not one that needs repiping.</p>
