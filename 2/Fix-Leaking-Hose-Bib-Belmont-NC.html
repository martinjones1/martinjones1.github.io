<h3>Leaky Faucets at Belmont NC - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system must be continuously kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>The simplest way to keep you and your household safe from the possible risks of backflow through cross connections is to not produce cross connections in the first place.
