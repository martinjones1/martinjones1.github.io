<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and in other places throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively used in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
