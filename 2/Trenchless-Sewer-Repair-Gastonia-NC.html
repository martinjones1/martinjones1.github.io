Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can lead to leakages. As these leakages occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes.
