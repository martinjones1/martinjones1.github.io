<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Kansas City KS</h3>
<p>The most efficient method to address difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, enabling air to go into the valve and restore pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
