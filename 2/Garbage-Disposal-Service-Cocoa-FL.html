<p>Root Invasion: Root intrusion describes what occurs when tree roots start to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This happens since the wetness in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots eventually do piece your drain lines, they can cause blockages, breaks, and back-ups which may result in comprehensive property damage. Look out for wet, green patches in your backyard, a persistent sewage smell in or around your house, an uptick in insect and rodent activity, and sluggish drains, as these are all typical signs of root invasion.</p>
<p>In municipal supply of water systems, water is generally maintained at a significant pressure to allow water to stream to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your house or company. When the pressure drops for some reason such as may happen when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to eliminate a fire or a water main breaks or some other circumstance takes place, polluted water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an event, there needs to be some kind of backflow prevention technique utilized. The very best and safest kind of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the component). The correct backflow prevention device is required if an air gap is not possible. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water provider.</p>
