<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct effect on your safety, convenience, comfort, and reliability than your plumbing system. This is incredibly crucial! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to press the waste out of your drain system. Existing policies restrict the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines. We offer two kinds of water treatment systems for difficult water: Advantage Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
<p>In the long run, a gas heater might be a cheaper option than an electric, however the preliminary cost of the heater and the installation can be substantially higher.

Smaller sized individuals and families might do better with an electric hot water heater, or an on-demand tankless" water heater as described in the section below.</p>
