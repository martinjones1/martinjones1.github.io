Water pressure may be or stop working reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
