<p>To identify if your house is a poly home," start with the outside. Underground water mains are usually blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in size.

We have discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
