<p>When compared to gas designs, electric models are much easier and less expensive to install as electrical energy is currently offered through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a specific gas line has to be installed and a practical source of gas developed. Another feature of an electrical hot water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas models need to be ventilated properly using vents and ducts in order to function correctly. With electric designs, you will not have to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
