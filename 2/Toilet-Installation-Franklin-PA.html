<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks in Franklin PA?</h3>
<p>We all know that plumbing in any home or house will establish obstructions. It happens to everybody. Lots of stopped-up sinks and plugged toilets can be fixed rapidly. You can rely on the professionals from Courtesy Plumbing Inc However does every WaterPro client need to install a backflow prevention device? The answer is: you need backflow prevention if you have a culinary water connection that may be used to provide a sprinkler system.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many home centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
