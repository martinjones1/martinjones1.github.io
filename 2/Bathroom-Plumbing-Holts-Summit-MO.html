<p>Some producers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Throughout regular operation, the pressure between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of lowered pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is created to open and release water to the exterior. An RPZ will periodically discharge small amounts of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ should be set up in areas that are exempt to water damage and permit appropriate drainage.</p>
