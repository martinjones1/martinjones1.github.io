<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

Blanc also built a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
