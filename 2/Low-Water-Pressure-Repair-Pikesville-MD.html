<p>As one of the most secondhand plumbing systems in your home, it's a given that your toilet will need repairs over time. However if your toilet is exhibiting any of the following signs, it may be time to replace it.

After getting rid of standing water from the sink, put about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain prior to you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a few minutes, and after that flush with hot water to clear the mix.</p>
