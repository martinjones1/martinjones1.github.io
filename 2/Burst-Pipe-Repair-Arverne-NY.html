<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After repairing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
