Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
