<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leakages happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these problems.</p>
<p>For RPZ gadgets, drainage capability will be sized to accommodate both intermittent discharges and a devastating failure of the relief valve.
