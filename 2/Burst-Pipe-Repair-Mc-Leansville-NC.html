Sodium ions are held loosely and are changed easily by calcium and magnesium ions. During this process, totally free" salt ions are launched into the water. The time in between recharging cycles depends on the solidity of the water, the amount of water used, the size of the system and the capability of the exchange media to remove solidity.</p>
