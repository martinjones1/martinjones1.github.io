<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system must be continuously kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
