These correspond directly to just how much waste the unit can handle, and suggested sizes are generally based on how many users are in a household. If your existing disposal clogs often, is loud, leaks or does not run correctly, it may be time for a replacement. Installations need to only be performed by plumbers as the installation requires both plumbing and electrical connections.</p>
<p>Nearly all makes can figure out the age of a water heater from the model and identification number. Have a licensed plumber figure out whether it's up to current code and safely working. Ask the plumber to assess and document the size of the hot water heater when they're out to perform the inspection, and whether it fulfills the needs of the house.</p>
