<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede versus the needed direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. There is capacity for the infected water to become a health threat if permitted to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for effectiveness, in addition to inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
