Nevertheless, many water softeners regenerate frequently, when the filter medium really isn't complete. This can be corrected by just resetting your water softener to remove less hardness or to run longer between regeneration cycles.</p>

<p>If you experience clogs and backups in your house more than a few times, it's an excellent concept to have a professional examine your drain system. A drain specialist like TLC will utilize a camera to inspect your drain system.

The camera can find and determine the problem so the drain can be repaired.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic system from your home.

This can happen in several locations and any combination of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all link, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from several drain lines in your home.</p>
