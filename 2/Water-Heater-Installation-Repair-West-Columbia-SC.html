<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service West Columbia SC</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Regrettably, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leaks take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these problems.</p>
