Our substantial water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water delivered to our consumers is kept free from harmful pollutants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to equipment including a nonpotable compound, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination may happen when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating and cooling system, into the safe and clean water system. This can happen through a process referred to as backflow.</p>
<p>As described previously in the short article, carbon monoxide is entirely odorless and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every house must have carbon monoxide detectors installed at the proper locations. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family homes to have both smoke and carbon monoxide gas detectors. They are typically sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new setups should have a 10-year non-serviceable kind of detector.</p>
