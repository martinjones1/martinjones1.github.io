<h3>How To Install A Sand Trap Drain Colorado Springs CO</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
