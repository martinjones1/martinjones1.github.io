<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and wish for the best is normal in our industry and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
