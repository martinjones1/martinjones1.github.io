Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

The particles of calcium combine, become heavier than the rest of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next action of the treatment process. Versatile gas lines are typically preferable to inflexible lines, especially in areas where earthquakes are more common and for the connection in between the supply and home appliance. Flexible gas lines are less most likely to be disconnected in a natural catastrophe which decreases the danger of a surge or fire.</p>
