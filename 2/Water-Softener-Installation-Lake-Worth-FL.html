Funneling happens when the inbound tough water follows a narrow course through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened.

<p>Another option is to use salt pellets in the salt water tank, but then install a reverse-osmosis water filter at the kitchen sink. The filter will get rid of salt from the water, which you can use for drinking and cooking. From multi-tank systems powered by the energy of moving water to a more standard approach, Kinetico covers all your choices. Your local Kinetico water professional will deal with you to pick the water softener that's right for you.</p>
