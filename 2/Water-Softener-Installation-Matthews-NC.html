Most people dump food waste in the trash, which indicates more garbage to go in garbage dumps or be incinerated.

<p>If your water heater has needed multiple repairs over the last couple of years, it may be time to get it replaced. A good rule of thumb for hot water heater is this: due to the fact that the life expectancy of the average hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
