<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the external finishing of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
