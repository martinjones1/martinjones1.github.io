<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
