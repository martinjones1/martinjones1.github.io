<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains substantial quantities of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a problem-- for its lots of designated usages around your home.</p>
<p>If you have actually checked out the paragraph above, you now comprehend that there numerous mechanical parts within your toilet's tank that allow your toilet to flush the water down the toilet bowl. When these parts become worn or break they need to be replaced.

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and identify the reason for the problem. The line was plainly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
