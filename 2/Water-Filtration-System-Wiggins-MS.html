<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- basically two layers of protection. The device enables water to press the check valves open when water is coming into the structure, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the incorrect way.

<p>Since of the intrinsic design of a reduced pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on an incredibly low flow or fixed circulation condition might trigger problem dripping and potential fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of fluctuating supply pressure.</p>
<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board encourages the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections regarding the administration of Post 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, including licensing. Backsiphonage takes place when there is a negative pressure in the water circulation system, which draws the water from a private water supply into the public water system. This can take place at any time, such as throughout a water main break or during a big firefighting effort.</p>
