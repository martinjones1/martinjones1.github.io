<p>To figure out which toilet valve is triggering the trouble, look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overflowing into the tube.

Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water discolorations and deterioration.
