<p>We carry the full array of Backflow prevention options. So which should you use? The plumbers at Clarke & Rush are professionals in repipe jobs, and qualified to help you make this crucial decision. We will ensure you understand your alternatives, the benefits and drawbacks, and make a recommendation so you can make an educated option. A waste disposal unit usually plugs into a 120-volt GFCI (ground-fault circuit interruptor) outlet under the sink. You'll have to have an electrical expert install one if an outlet like this isn't available under your sink.</p>
<p>The repair service technician should be able to identify the lots of various makers and the specific models produced throughout the years. Some designs may appear similar on the outside but could need various repair parts on the inside, so the repair technician need to have the ability to identify the make, design and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that may have been produced. In some cases the serial number of the assembly will be needed to differentiate one design from another. It is important to understand the right model to guarantee you get the correct repair parts.</p>

<p>At least as soon as every 3 months, drain water from the tank. In time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper efficiency, and draining pipes a gallon or so helps eliminate the sediment. If you spot a leak and go with a patching job instead of a repiping task, simply remember that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the exact same product and they may be next. To prevent further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to consider repiping your entire home when you identify a leak.</p>
