<p>Read your insurance coverage policy thoroughly if your polybutylene pipes have stopped working. Make certain you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Lots of insurance companies will not cover a sluggish leak. Claims may be denied because the basic HO-3 house owners' policy particularly omits "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over an extended amount of time." Call your insurance representative and validate your coverage. Double check with your agent to verify that your understanding is correct once you have actually checked out through your policy and verified what is covered and what is not covered.</p>
