<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains significant amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon for how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a nuisance-- for its many desired usages around your house.</p>
