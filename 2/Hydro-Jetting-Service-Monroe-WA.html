<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so just softened water passes through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is typically utilized in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
