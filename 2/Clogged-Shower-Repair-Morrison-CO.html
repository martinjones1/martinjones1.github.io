<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic tank from your house. When you experience blockages in several drains simultaneously in your house, then that normally implies that your main sewer line is backing up. This can occur in multiple places and any mix of drains. For instance, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous mixes of this type of backup. The point is your drains all link, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the offender. But not constantly. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can cause difficulty too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
