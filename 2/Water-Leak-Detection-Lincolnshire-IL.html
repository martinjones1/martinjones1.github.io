<p>If a cable television has actually not yet been run to the junction box, you can make the connections within the new disposer any time beforehand, joining the cable to the wires in the box just before or just after mounting the disposer. Garbage disposals are pretty easy to keep. The most crucial thing to bear in mind is that they are actually food disposals. Products that would otherwise enter the garbage should not be placed in your disposal. This consists of glass, plastic, metals (yes, silverware), paper, anything combustible, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were extremely responsive and timely to send me a bid which was really competitive. They were extremely professional and did an awesome job. I would definitely call them once again for my plumbing requires. Now, if this staining only appears when warm water is being used, then the rust most likely exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is naturally still a problem that needs to be dealt with immediately (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) however not one that needs repiping.</p>
