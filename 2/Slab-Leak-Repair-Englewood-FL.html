<p>Noticeable odor. The moment you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the backyard, basement, or anywhere in your house or business area, provide us a call. That smell may be originating from your sewer system, which needs repair right away. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that gets rid of sewage from your house, launches sewer gas, and manages air pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually failed, it will frequently need to be replaced instead of fixed. If your pipes are gurgling or releasing foul odors, you'll know this.</p>
