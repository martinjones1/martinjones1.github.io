Gas storage tank systems use practically 50% less energy, costing less to operate, than the electric variety. However, they cost a bit more than electric designs. They also include a temperature level and pressure-release valve that opens when either temperature level or pressure exceeds predetermined levels. We supply gas water heater service, in addition to electric water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Coast.</p>
