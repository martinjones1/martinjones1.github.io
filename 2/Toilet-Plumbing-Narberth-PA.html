<h3>Clogged Drains in Narberth Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least 3 attempts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his knowledge and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the particles decreased the newly cleaned up main drain. By including perseverence and patience the job was done to my complete fulfillment.</p>
<p>Electric hot water heater have a shorter life-span than gas water heaters of similar quality and capability.
