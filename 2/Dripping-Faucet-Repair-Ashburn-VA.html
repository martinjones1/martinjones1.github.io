<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather protection. As the external coating of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The current dual flush HET used by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We suggest, as the majority of plumbers do, to utilize disposals moderately. Proper care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
