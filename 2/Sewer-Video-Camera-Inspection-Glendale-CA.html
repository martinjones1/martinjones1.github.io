<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber Glendale CA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
