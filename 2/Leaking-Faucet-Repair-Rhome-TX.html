<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually frequently been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mainly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to customer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening just gets rid of hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a problem and not a risk to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not necessity. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
<p>When pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the drinkable system providing the cosmetics water, backpressure is created. This can force the drinkable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Prospective pollutants can then go into the drinkable water supply.
