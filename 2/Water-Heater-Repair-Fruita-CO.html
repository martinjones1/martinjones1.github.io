<p>Aside from water trickling and the occasional creak, your pipes should not be making any odd sounds, particularly not ones loud enough to keep you up during the night. If your pipes are rattling, clanking, banging or making other obnoxious sounds, that's a proven indication of a bigger problem. Have your pipes checked as soon as possible so you do not end up with a significant leak.</p>

This can increase the amount of time needed to install the brand-new unit, for that reason increasing costs. This truly depends on what condition the remainder of the pipes remain in, and how tough the old system is to eliminate. In many cases, removal will only add an additional $25 to $50 to the total costs, but in many cases the costs might be higher if additional pipes must likewise be changed.</p>
