<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may need to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug package that I bought independently from the disposal system. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the culprit. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
