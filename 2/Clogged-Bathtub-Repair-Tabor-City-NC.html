<p>When the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be removed from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from vital areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>

<p>In water circulation systems, water is generally maintained at a considerable pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may stop working or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water supply (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
