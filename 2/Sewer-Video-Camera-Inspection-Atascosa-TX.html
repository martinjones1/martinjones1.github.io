<h3>Clogged Drains in Atascosa Texas</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had actually supported into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least three efforts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his knowledge and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the particles went down the newly cleaned up main drain.
