<p>IRWD is dedicated to delivering safe, high quality water to consumers. Our comprehensive water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water delivered to our consumers is kept devoid of hazardous impurities. A vital part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to equipment including a nonpotable compound, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination might occur when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or cooling and heating system, into the safe and clean water system. This can occur through a procedure called backflow.</p>
<p>The easiest method to keep you and your family safe from the potential dangers of backflow through cross connections is to not develop cross connections in the very first place. However, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, pool, water feature or other kind of cross connection, have an authorized backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
