<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Greenwood AR</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
