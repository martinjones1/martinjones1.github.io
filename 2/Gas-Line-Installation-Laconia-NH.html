Like any home device, a toilet tank features numerous small moving parts that might need replaced with use over time.

Toilet leaks around the base can also occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>The easiest option may seem to be merely neglecting the issue or using a do it yourself chemical option. Nevertheless, this is a momentary fix and might trigger more damage.
