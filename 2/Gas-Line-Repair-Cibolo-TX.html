<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and determine the reason for the problem. The line was clearly weakening; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
