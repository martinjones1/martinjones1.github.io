Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals bring favorable charges, so water softeners utilize salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with drinkable water, you are needed to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, drinkable and watering, you are also needed to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
