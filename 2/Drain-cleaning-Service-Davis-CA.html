<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Cost Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were prompt and very responsive to send me a bid which was really competitive. They were extremely professional and did an amazing job. I would absolutely call them once again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration just appears when warm water is being utilized, then the rust probably exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes.
