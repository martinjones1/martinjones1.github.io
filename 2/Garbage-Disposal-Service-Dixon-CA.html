<p>As soon as the components are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be eliminated from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will collect.</p>
