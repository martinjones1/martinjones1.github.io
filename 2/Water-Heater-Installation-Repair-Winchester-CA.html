<p>Backflow prevention protects safe and clean water supply from potential threats. There are over 10,000 reported cases of backflow contamination each year. Backflow devices are required by law and must be set up in accordance with plumbing or building regulations. There are many different kinds of backflow preventers utilized in various applications. Your hot water heater stores water in a holding tank and makes sure that it is all set for you to utilize.
