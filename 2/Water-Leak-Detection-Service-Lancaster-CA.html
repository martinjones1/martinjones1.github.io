<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation direction within a piping system that is triggered by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of normal flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

<p>Throughout regular operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of minimized pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is designed to release and open water to the outside. An RPZ will occasionally release small amounts of water due to change in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be installed in locations that are not subject to water damage and allow appropriate drainage.</p>
