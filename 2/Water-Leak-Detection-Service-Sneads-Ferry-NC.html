<p>To determine which toilet valve is triggering the trouble, take a look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing entirely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so beautiful inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water discolorations and corrosion. But do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
