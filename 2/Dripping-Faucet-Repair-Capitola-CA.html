<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the structure; additional, more substantial costs can happen if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for residents. A PE or RA can help determine if setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>

How the disposal is linked to the sink varies based upon brand name and type. Refer to your item instructions or get in touch with the manufacturer if you need assistance. The disposal will usually be connected to the drain line with either a nut or a screw.</p>
