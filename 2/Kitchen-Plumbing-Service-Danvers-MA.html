Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
