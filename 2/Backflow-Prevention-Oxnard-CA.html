<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had actually backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least three attempts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl.

<p>This is a totally valid question that we hear a lot. The disposal system is not, naturally, as essential as your hot water heater, water line, or drainpipes.

Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily stream into the drain pipe in addition to the rest of your wastewater.</p>
