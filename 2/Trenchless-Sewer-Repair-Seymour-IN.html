<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
