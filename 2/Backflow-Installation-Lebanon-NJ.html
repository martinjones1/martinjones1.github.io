No, it is not a frequent event, however it does happen more often than you think! Typically it takes place during the night when you do not see the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a brand-new pipe. This makes construction tasks quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding areas.</p>
