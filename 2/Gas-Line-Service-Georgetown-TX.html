Water pressure might stop working or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water supply (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
