<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures inoperable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain appropriately or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can assist. Often drain repair needs can be solved fairly rapidly by a skilled handyman. At other times, however, parts of a drain might need to be dismantled, analyzed, and cleared prior to being changed. In many cases, a handyman may figure out that a replacement part is required (like a reducer, pvc, or tailpiece  trap) to ensure regular operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman representative today to go over repair alternatives.</p>
<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to remove the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals bring positive charges, so water softeners use sodium ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with safe and clean water, you are needed to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, safe and clean and irrigation, you are also needed to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up needing to be effectively re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
