<h3>Three Ways To Find An Emergency Plumber Near Me Woodruff SC</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
