<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
