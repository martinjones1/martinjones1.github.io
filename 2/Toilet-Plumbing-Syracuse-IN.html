<h3>Need A Plumber Service Syracuse IN</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
