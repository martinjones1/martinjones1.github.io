<p>The fuel line of your vehicle products gas from the fuel tank to the carburetor, making the combustion needed for the engine to run. You might have a gas leak from the fuel line if you smell a strong whiff of gas from your vehicle when it is running. It is important to repair this immediately to prevent a surge.

<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your house. When the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is generally used in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
<p>If you 'd like to get rid of the salt, just fill the salt water tank with potassium chloride pellets, not salt pellets. The only problem is that potassium chloride is pricey: $25 to $30 per 50-pound bag. Salt costs $4 to $6 per bag.

A lot of high-pressure water jetters will run with approximately 4,000 PSI of pressure and will push anywhere from 2-18 gallons of water per minute through a pipe.</p>
