Throughout regrowth, salted water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
<p>If there's an existing disposal, use the handy self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket.
