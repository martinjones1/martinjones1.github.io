<p>You need to spend at least $50 to get a top quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a resilient surface and a reliable stopper mechanism. The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper doesn't have any parts that can use, however screwing it in and out can be annoying. The twist-and-drop design is much easier to use but requires periodic -ring replacement.</p>
