Scale reduces circulation through pipes and is a poor conductor of heat. Ultimately, pipes can end up being completely clogged.</p>
<p>Mixing vaporized salt with rock salt is not suggested, as this might clog the softening reservoir. It is advised that you allow your unit to go empty of one type of salt prior to including another to avoid the occurrence of any problems.
