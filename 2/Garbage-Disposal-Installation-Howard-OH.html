<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the building; additional, more considerable expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being a concern for residents. If installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help determine.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is common in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively working together that you can achieve this.</p>
