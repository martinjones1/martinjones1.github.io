<p>Liners are another popular product sewer cleaners offer these days. A liner is a cloth tube covered on one side with a layer of PVC, which is embedded with a two-part epoxy resin. Provider then typically blow the liner into an existing pipe. If your home was constructed before the 1970s or hasn't been redesigned, you will most likely have old pipes that need replacing.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might need to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug set that I purchased individually from the disposal system. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
