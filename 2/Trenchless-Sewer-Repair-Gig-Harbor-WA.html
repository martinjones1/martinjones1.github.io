<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Gig Harbor WA</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening.

Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
