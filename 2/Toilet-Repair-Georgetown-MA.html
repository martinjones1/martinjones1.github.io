<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits.

<p>Having an Expert technician like one from Donelson Air Service Experts fix the issue and determine can help catch other parts that might be about to break.

<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, permitting air to get in the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
