<p>Corrosion is an intricate phenomenon and there are numerous factors that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water distribution system and premise plumbing. For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that accelerate corrosion Likewise, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of corrosion control. Thus, thinking about all these factors, in addition to arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that a correctly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>

<p>Many houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the outer coating of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
