<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Braintree MA</h3>
<p>The most effective way to address hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the inside of the used pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin spots leak right away and often those leakages come weeks or days later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up requiring to be appropriately re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
