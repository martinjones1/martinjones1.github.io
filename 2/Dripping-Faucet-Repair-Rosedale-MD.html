<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Rosedale MD?</h3>
<p>Deterioration is an intricate phenomenon and there are lots of elements that accelerate deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and premise plumbing. For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that accelerate corrosion Likewise, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of corrosion control. Therefore, considering all these factors, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
