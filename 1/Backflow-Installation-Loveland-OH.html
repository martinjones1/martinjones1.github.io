<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current double flush HET offered by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We suggest, as the majority of plumbers do, to use disposals sparingly. Proper care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
