Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself.

For this factor, the RPZ must be set up in locations that are exempt to water damage and permit appropriate drainage.</p>
