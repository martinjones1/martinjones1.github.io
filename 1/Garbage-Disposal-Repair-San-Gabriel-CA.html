<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
