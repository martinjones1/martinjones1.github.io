<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in Pearl River NY!</h3>
<p>What is difficult water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains significant amounts of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey.
