Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leaks happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these problems.</p>
