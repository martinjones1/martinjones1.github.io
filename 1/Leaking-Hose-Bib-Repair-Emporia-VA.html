<p>Liners are another popular product sewer cleaners offer these days. A liner is a cloth tube covered on one side with a layer of PVC, which is embedded with a two-part epoxy resin.

<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is a sudden decrease in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as during fire combating or when a water main breaks.

Their components are an insulated tank, normally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water until it's needed.
