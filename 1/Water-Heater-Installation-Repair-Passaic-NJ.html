<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched.
