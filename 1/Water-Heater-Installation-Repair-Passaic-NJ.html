When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads.
