<p>Inappropriate drainage slope: Drainage pipes are developed to take waste water far from a house and provide it to the city's sewer system. Most do this using the power of gravity; pipes are sloped to drain water towards the street. Waste water may not drain correctly and could flood back into the building if the drainage pipes are not set up at the proper degree of slope.</p>
<p>For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a blockage or can trigger rust that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Sound-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and removes from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning professionals are called into a residence is since there is too much hair in the shower drain.
