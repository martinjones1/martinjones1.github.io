<p>Steamfitters and pipefitters, in some cases merely called fitters, install and keep pipes that might carry acids, chemicals, and gases. These pipes are mostly in production, commercial, and industrial settings. Fitters install and repair pipe systems in power plants, in addition to heating and cooling systems in big office buildings. Steamfitters focus on systems that are created for the flow of liquids or gases at high pressure. Other fitters might specialize as gasfitters or sprinklerfitters.</p>

Similarly, you will discover the security practices, plumbing codes, working rules, and different policies surrounding the plumbing industry. General studies referring to physics, preparing, mathematics, chemistry, and plan reading would also be dealt with.</p>
