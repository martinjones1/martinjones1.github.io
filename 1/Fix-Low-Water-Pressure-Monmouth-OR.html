<h3>Fix Leaking Faucet in Monmouth Oregon</h2>
<p>Insert the flange on the top of the sink, and attach the attachment system on the underside (Image 1). It is helpful to use pressure on the flange from above utilizing a second set of hands or a heavy things. This will keep the flange in place while attaching the securing system below. Make sure the plumber's putty is noticeably oozing beyond the edge of the flange all around (Image 2). As soon as a complete seal has formed, get rid of the excess putty with a rag.</p>
