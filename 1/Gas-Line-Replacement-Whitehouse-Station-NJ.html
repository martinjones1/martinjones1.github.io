Before entering into how to repair a toilet, it would benefit to understand how a toilet works.  Most homes in the US, consisting of Tampa Bay Area, have what is referred to as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets also have a flapper seal made of rubber at the bottom of the tank that keeps the water in the tank up until the toilet is flushed.  This seal degrades with time enabling water to escape into the toilet bowl, thus reducing the amount of water in the tank available for a flush.  It also has the drawback of increasing your water expense due to wastage of water.</p>
<p>During typical operation, the pressure in between the two check valves, described as the zone of lowered pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is designed to open and release water to the exterior if either check valve ought to leak. An RPZ will periodically release percentages of water due to change in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ should be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and enable sufficient drainage.</p>
