<p>Poorly installed gas lines lead to gas leaks. Gas leaks are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy project. The gas lines have to be adjusted to the right levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home."
