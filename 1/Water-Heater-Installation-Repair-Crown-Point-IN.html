<p>Backflow preventers are vital for creating a safe water system system. No matter which model you pick, all water softeners need to be properly kept. The salt water option should be blended and kept in the brine tank. Periodic clogging of the resin also requires special attention.

If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Also, fungis and bacteria also form mats in the resin that reduce its effectiveness. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or occasionally cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these problems.
