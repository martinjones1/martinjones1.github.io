For these factors, your water district should take precautions to secure its public water supply versus backflow.</p>
<p>Frequent leaks: Leaks originating from your hot water heater are never ever a great indication. If your water heater has frequent leakages or is constantly needing repairs, it is likely more economical to replace the whole unit. A backflow preventer is a device that's installed on your home's water pipes that enables water to flow in one direction but never in the opposite instructions. Its sole task is to prevent drinking water from being infected due to backflow.</p>
