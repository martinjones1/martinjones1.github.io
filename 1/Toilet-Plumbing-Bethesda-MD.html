The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage only for non-health risk or health danger conditions. They should be installed downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should likewise be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local authorities, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some municipalities do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only protect against back siphonage.</p>
