<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is typical in our industry and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can attain this.</p>
