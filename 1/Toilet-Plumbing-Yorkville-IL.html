<p>Deterioration is a complicated phenomenon and there are lots of elements that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that speed up deterioration Also, there is a lack of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of rust control.
