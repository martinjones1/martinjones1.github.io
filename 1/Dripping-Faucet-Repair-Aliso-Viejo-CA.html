<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these small deposits are safe, but over time they develop and eventually clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically restrict the water circulation, which puts unnecessary pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
<h3>Kitchen and Bath Hook-ups in Aliso Viejo California</h2>

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, however if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can position problems.</p>
