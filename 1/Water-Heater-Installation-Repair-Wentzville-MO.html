So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers handle all types of work.

<p>A brand-new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the within used thin pipe and the painting the inside of the used pipe with epoxy paint.

A few of those thin areas leak right away and sometimes those leakages come weeks or days later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up requiring to be correctly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
