<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes in Chester NY</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a problem-- for its many intended uses around your house.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health risk if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, triggered the spread of sickness or illness.</p>
