<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains significant amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite an annoyance-- for its numerous intended uses around your house.</p>
<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually typically been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due mainly to overstated advertising and, in part, to customer misconceptions about water treatment.

The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers personal choice not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
