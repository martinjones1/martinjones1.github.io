<p>Root Intrusion: Root intrusion describes what takes place when tree roots begin to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This occurs because the moisture in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots.

In situ corrosion examination on the impact of softened and tough water to domestic copper and galvanized steel drinking water systems." METALogic.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and determine the reason for the issue. The line was clearly weakening; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
