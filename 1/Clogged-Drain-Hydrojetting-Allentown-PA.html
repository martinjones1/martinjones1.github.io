Understanding if you have galvanized water pipes, copper drain pipes, lead closet bends, or an inferior piping system can be convenient when negotiating the sale of a home. There are so many types of piping systems and conditions, it's a great concept to get a whole home plumbing inspection in addition to a water heater and sewer camera inspection.</p>
<p>Be aware that softened water consists of trace quantities of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water consists of about the same quantity of salt as a slice of bread. That's not very much salt, but for those on a rigorous sodium-free diet plan it may be too much. If this does not work, you might need to replace one of your toilet's parts, generally the flapper. There might also be a concern with the chain connected to the flapper or the float ball. A plumber can easily replace these parts.</p>
