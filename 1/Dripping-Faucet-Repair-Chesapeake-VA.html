<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Chesapeake VA</h3>

<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to a climatic vent.

This sets off the disc to open, allowing air to enter the valve and restore pressure comparable to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
