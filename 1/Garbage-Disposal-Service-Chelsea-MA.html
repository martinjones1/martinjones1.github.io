<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capability and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean.

When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth automatically starts. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regeneration normally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
