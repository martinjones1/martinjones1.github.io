<p>Rust is a complicated phenomenon and there are numerous factors that accelerate rust in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that accelerate deterioration Likewise, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective form of rust control. Therefore, considering all these factors, along with arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
