<h3>Gas Dryer Hook Up in Brownsville Tennessee</h2>

<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your home. When the resin bed fills with firmness ions, it needs to be restored (cleaned up). Salt is normally used in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>

This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
