<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains significant quantities of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a problem-- for its lots of intended uses around your home.</p>
