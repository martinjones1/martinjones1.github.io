<p>Backflow threatens because it can contaminate the general public drinking supply with contaminants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and damaging chemicals. In 2010, for instance, students at a Bowling Green, Kentucky grade school suffered nausea and other signs after a contractor dealing with the A/C system caused the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has actually frequently been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to overstated advertising and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening just removes hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are an annoyance and not a risk to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers personal preference not necessity. However, water softening does have benefits, and drawbacks, that make this decision a considerable one.</p>
<p>The level 3 of maintenance your disposal unit will need can vary depending on how typically it's used, its age, and the kind of items you're putting in it.

While stoppers can help, in some cases clogged drains are unavoidable. When this occurs, don't think twice to call Larry & Sons. Our team of plumbers react to service calls quickly, and use the current technology to target bothersome locations so you can return to the comfort of your home.</p>
