<p>Since the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to become covered inside, New homes developed with copper pipes are specifically prone to corrosive water conditions.

See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of brand-new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
