<p>Since the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to become covered inside, New homes developed with copper pipes are specifically prone to corrosive water conditions. As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a period of three to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of brand-new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
