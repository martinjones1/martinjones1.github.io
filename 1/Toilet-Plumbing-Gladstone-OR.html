<p>Often called an auger, this handy tool can clear obstructions that might be stuck even more down the system. You'll need to take apart the drain and P-trap that runs underneath the kitchen sink to expose the stub pipe" or stubout" that takes a trip behind the cabinet wall.

<p>When selecting the appropriate system defense there are several considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be taken a look at on an individual basis as a distinct stand-alone system. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of lawn sprinkler consists of the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire protection system are developed to match the danger that exists in the locations they are installed in. As building types and contents of these structures can be very different, we need to comprehend that the fire defense system for any installation needs to be developed and set up to satisfy that particular risk or need. An aircraft hangar will need an extremely different fire defense system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow protection requirements for these 2 examples would likewise differ significantly.</p>
