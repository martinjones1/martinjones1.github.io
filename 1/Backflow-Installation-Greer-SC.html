<p>The easiest method to keep you and your household safe from the potential threats of backflow through cross connections is to not produce cross connections in the very first location. However, if you do have a cross connection to a sprinkler system system, boiler, swimming pool, water function or other type of cross connection, have an authorized backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
<p>The system has actually gone back to a no need condition (no valves open downstream). However, debris between the # 1 Examine Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the parts, is preventing the # 1 Inspect from closing all the method.

When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring presses back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
