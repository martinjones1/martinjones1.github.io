Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

<p>If you experience clogs and backups in your house more than a couple of times, it's a great concept to have a professional assess your drain system. A drain expert like TLC will utilize a camera to examine your drain system. Typically, if you have numerous drain problems you may have a drain line break someplace in your home or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can find and identify the issue so the drain can be repaired.</p>
<p>Sometimes you understand you have a sewer line break since you can smell nasty odors or you have a sewage back-up in your house. It is important to pinpoint the exact area of the break in your sewer line. Many times the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and understanding this can conserve you thousands of dollars in repairs. Simply sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can solve the problem. The professionals and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you always have a copy for your insurance realtor, company or city inspector.</p>

Whenever you remodel a part of your home, take the opportunity to examine-- and if need be, replace-- any plumbing lines that you expose when you open the floors and walls. This includes not just the plumbing in the kitchen or bathroom that you're remaking, but also any pipes going through the walls to feed upstairs bathrooms.</p>
