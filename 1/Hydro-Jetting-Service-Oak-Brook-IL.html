<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
