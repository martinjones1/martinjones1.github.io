After we have actually cleaned the body, and the fixed parts are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be tricky, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system needs to be made use of to ensure the line is correctly flushed.</p>
<p>The toilet takes a really long period of time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout regular operation, the pressure between the two check valves-- referred to as the zone of reduced pressure-- is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is designed to open and release water to the outdoors, ensuring backflow never happens.</p>
