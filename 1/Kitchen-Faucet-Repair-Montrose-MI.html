<p>Some plumbers charge more for their services than others, but that's usually a sign of their quality. Usually speaking, more skilled plumbers will charge more for their services. Tankless water heaters get rid of the long wait for heat of the traditional hot water tank. Plumbing pipes, like whatever else, wear with time. Typically, it is best to replace the pipes when the damage is too substantial for repair. For instance, if the pipes are rusted, continuous leak problems will take place and changing the pipes is the better alternative If repiping is needed, we will examine your pipes to determine.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a severe public health risk if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, caused the spread of sickness or disease.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to prevent backflow. The standard means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The basic mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and performs regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report need to be provided to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in hard water can cause a bad odor and taste. When you add a water softener, it eliminates the mineral content to produce odorless drinking water that tastes great.</p>
