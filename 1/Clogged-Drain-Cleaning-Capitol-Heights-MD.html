<p>And so, we see the transition from substantial transport pipelines (aqueducts) providing water to whole cities to large distribution pipes (mains) servicing smaller sized neighborhoods or large centers, to medium distribution pipelines and lastly to little service pipelines. Each stage in the water supply and circulation system needs to handle varying flow rates, circulation velocities and pressure heads, in addition to different levels of direct exposure to potential backwash or contaminant seepage and the subsequent need for protection with backflow preventers.</p>

After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than likely means your toilet has a leak. This issue is often brought on by a rusty pipe, flush valve assembly or as basic as a worn flapper valve.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by constantly bringing tanks online and off-line in action to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, only one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive style allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
