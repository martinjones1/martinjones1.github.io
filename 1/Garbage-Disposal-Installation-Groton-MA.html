<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Groton MA</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular incident, however it does take place more frequently than you believe! Frequently it happens during the night when you do not notice the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or link a new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding communities.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
