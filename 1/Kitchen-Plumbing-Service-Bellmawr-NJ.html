<p>Cold showers? High energy costs? It might be time for a brand-new warm water heater. But in order to reap the benefits of a new energy-efficient device, you'll need to have it installed effectively.

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are installed in areas where water could cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
