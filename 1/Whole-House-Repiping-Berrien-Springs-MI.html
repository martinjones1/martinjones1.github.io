To just put some media inside a tank and expect the very best is typical in our industry and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
