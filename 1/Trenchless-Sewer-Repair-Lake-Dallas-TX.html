Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
