<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which designs are best for particular applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are spelled out by local statutes and ecological regulations. Local building regulations for example will need a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air gap in between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any prospective siphon prior to it can take place, preventing polluting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more complex and sophisticated backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical devices set up to avoid backflow range from the fairly simple to the complex and very advanced.</p>
