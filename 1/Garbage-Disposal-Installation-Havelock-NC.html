<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole.
