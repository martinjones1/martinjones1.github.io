<p>Place the flange on the top of the sink, and connect the attachment system on the underside (Image 1). It is handy to apply pressure on the flange from above utilizing a second set of hands or a heavy object. This will keep the flange in place while connecting the fastening system below. Make certain the plumber's putty is visibly oozing beyond the edge of the flange all around (Image 2). As soon as a complete seal has formed, remove the excess putty with a rag.</p>
