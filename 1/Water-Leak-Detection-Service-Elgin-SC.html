<h3>Basic Methods for Refrigerant Leak Detection in Elgin SC</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system needs to be continuously kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers carry just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
