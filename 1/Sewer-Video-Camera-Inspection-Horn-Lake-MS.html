<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and elsewhere during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively utilized in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
