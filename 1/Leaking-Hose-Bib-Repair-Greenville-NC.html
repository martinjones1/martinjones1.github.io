<p>Woodbury, in addition to many other communities and companies, has actually discovered the best method to prevent these spots from happening is by reducing the variety of times your water softener restores. "Regrowing" refers to the method softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "exhausted" or complete. However, lots of water softeners regenerate frequently, when the filter medium really isn't full. This can be corrected by merely resetting your water softener to remove less solidity or to run longer in between regeneration cycles.</p>

<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most widespread and disastrous water problems: hard water.  Hard water damaged the modern home. Scale builds up in your pipes, obstructing them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale significantly reduces the life expectancy of appliances like dishwashers, coffee makers and ice machines. Difficult water destroys hot water devices. The greater the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and strengthen into strong deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>
