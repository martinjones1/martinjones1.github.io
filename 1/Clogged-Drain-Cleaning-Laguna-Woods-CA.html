As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new home for a duration of 3 to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of brand-new homes are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>
