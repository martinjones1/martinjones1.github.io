Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A lot of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really hazardous if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable precautions.</p>
<p>Release piping linked to a storm sewer shall be geared up with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices suggests a DCV assembly on wet or dry lawn sprinkler unless there is a risk of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
