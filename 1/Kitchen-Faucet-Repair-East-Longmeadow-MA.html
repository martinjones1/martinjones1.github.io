<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in East Longmeadow MA</h3>

<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers carry only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the building; extra, more substantial costs can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for homeowners. If installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
<p>Tester qualifications: Just an individual licensed by the Minnesota Department of Labor and Market as a backflow preventer tester" might perform backflow preventer tests. Discover how to install a brand-new waste disposal unit under a kitchen sink with these step-by-step directions.
