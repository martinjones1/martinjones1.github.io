When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. If permitted to re-enter the water system, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health risk.
