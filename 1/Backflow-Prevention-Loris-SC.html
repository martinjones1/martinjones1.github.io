<p>The toilet takes a really long time to flush. Here's how it works: During normal operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves-- described as the zone of decreased pressure-- is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve ought to leak, the relief valve is created to open and discharge water to the outdoors, guaranteeing backflow never ever happens.</p>
<p>When the safe and clean supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might occur. Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not correctly safeguarded, potable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the drinkable supply system.</p>
