<p>Water softener systems work by removing solidity minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that manages water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that ranges from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't installed appropriately, you may experience an often or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in wasted water.</p>
