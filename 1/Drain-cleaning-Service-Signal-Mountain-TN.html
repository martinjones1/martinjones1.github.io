<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the potable system offering the cosmetics water, backpressure is developed. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Prospective impurities can then enter the potable water supply. The best method to minimize build-up is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially difficult with high mineral material, you may need to flush the water heater more often.</p>
