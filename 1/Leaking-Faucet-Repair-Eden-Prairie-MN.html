<h3>How To Find The Best Plumbing Services Eden Prairie MN</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
