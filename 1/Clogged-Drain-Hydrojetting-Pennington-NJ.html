<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further examination, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed.
