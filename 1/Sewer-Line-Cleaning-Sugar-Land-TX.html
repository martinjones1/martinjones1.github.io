<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board recommends the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections regarding the administration of Article 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, consisting of licensing. Backsiphonage occurs when there is a negative pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a private water system into the public water system. This can happen at any time, such as during a water main break or during a large firefighting effort.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is typical in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
