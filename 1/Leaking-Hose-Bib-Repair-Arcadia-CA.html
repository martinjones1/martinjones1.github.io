These flanges are simple and extensively offered to install, costing around $30 in your home improvement or hardware stores. Shut off the supply of water to your house at the main line.

Make sure your hot water heater's water supply is switched off, as is the electrical energy running to the system.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
