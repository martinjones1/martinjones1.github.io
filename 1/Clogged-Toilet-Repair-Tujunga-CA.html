<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Tujunga CA</h3>

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close.
