<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement at Spring Grove IL</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system should be continually kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
