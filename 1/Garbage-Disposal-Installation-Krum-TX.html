If the water level is below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, continuous outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing completely. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water spots and corrosion.
