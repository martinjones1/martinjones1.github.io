<p>A & frac13; HP or 1/2 HP waste disposal unit system can grind soft, non-fibrous foods. There is really little insulation in the weaker designs. Here are some typical types of waste disposal unit you might wish to consider. There are usually two kinds of disposals: aluminum and stainless steel. Aluminum disposals are the most affordable, costing about $70 to $150 a pop but are vulnerable to rust and leaking.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you may have to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug kit that I purchased independently from the disposal system. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>When the new unit is securely installed under the sink, it's time to hook up the plumbing, a process that's largely the same whatever install is utilized. The specifics - where you start, just how much you cut, and how it's all arranged - are special to each installation.
