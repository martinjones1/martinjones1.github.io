TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are geared up with this type of camera to determine and repair the drain issue.

<p>If your hot water heater has actually required multiple repairs over the last couple of years, it may be time to get it changed. A great general rule for water heaters is this: since the life-span of the typical hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
