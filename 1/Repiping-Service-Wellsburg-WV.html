Local plumber quoted price of $400 to install plus cost of garbage disposal. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ delighted I inspected around. Under the sink, position a bucket or pan underneath the drain, then use locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to disconnect the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's waste pipe. To loosen up the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
<p>5. Pour warm water down your drain after utilizing the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, wash your drain with a little bit of hot water. Whether tree roots have made their way into your pipes or you flushed something you should not have, a clogged toilet is never ever an enjoyable experience.
