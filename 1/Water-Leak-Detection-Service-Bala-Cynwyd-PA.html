Prior to entering into how to repair a toilet, it would benefit to comprehend how a toilet works.  Most homes in the United States, consisting of Tampa Bay Area, have what is referred to as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets also have a flapper seal made of rubber at the bottom of the cistern that keeps the water in the tank till the toilet is flushed.  This seal weakens in time allowing water to get away into the toilet bowl, thus reducing the amount of water in the tank readily available for a flush.  It also has the drawback of increasing your water bill due to waste of water.</p>
<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that manages water flow in your toilet.

After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't installed correctly, you might experience a frequently or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in squandered water.</p>
