<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To just put some media inside a tank and wish for the best is common in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization appropriately interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
