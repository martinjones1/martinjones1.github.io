<p>You'll notice that water runs to refill the bowl Whenever you flush your toilet. Nevertheless, in a properly working toilet, the water needs to stop running when the bowl is filled to its proper capability.

These leaks are very inefficient, as more than a hundred gallons of water end up traveling through the overflow.</p>
