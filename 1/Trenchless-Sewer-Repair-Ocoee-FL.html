<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Ocoee FL</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
