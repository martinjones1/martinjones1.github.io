<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Wheaton IL</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be needed to be located on the water service line, within the structure, or both areas. After an initial inspection and testing of a freshly installed backflow preventer, the water customer is needed to have the backflow preventer tested on an annual basis.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were timely and really responsive to send me a bid which was very competitive. They were extremely professional and did a remarkable job. I would certainly call them once again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration only appears when warm water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still an issue that requires to be dealt with immediately (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
