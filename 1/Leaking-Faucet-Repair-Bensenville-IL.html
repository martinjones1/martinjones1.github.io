<p>Both approaches are extremely effective and reducing waste and clearing it. The greatest difference remains in timing. With a batch disposal, you fill the unit, cover it, then turn it on. If it's totally complete, it will take a bit to clear through the waste, and if you discover you forgot something, you need to wait up until it's done to put the new waste in.</p>
<p>Sound is normal, however when you discover that the sounds are all there but food is not being ground up it is likely that the motor has gone. Some sounds show the need for repairs or a good clean out, and you can provide the system a great check before starting to price brand-new ones. However if your disposal is old enough, repairs will cost you cash for extremely little future use.</p>
