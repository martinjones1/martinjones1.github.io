<p>Follow with a plunger if the baking soda and white vinegar method does not work. Fill the sink with water and strongly plunge up and down for a number of minutes to remove the clog. When working with a double bowl kitchen sink, stuff the other opening with a rag, which helps apply extra pressure to the clog. For obstructions that take place even more down the pipe, use a cable television auger or plumber's snake. These tools are made from long, versatile steel cable wound around a spindle with a hand crank. To use a cable auger, get rid of the horizontal P-trap beneath the sink, ensuring it is not clogged before proceeding. Pull out 18 inches of cable television at a time, crank the handle in a clockwise direction and press the auger forward at the same time. Repeat the process, pulling out an additional 18 inches up until you break through the clog. Sometimes loose debris will settle into a new clog. Follow with a plunger, if required.</p>
