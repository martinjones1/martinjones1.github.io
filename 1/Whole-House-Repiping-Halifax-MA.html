It will make your clothing whiter and brighter, and naturally, it makes cleaning a breeze. You eliminate spots, streaks and residue on fixtures and showers as well, and one of the very best parts is that you have spot-free dishes and silverware.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, dishwasher, and boiler, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these little deposits are safe, but gradually they develop and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically restrict the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

The resultant gap breaks any prospective siphon prior to it can happen, avoiding polluting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more sophisticated and complicated backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices installed to prevent backflow range from the relatively easy to the really advanced and complex.</p>
