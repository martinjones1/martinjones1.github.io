<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service North Bend WA</h3>
<p>We genuinely appreciate our customers and the services that we offer. As hard water passes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with salt ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are replaced quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. During this process, totally free" salt ions are launched into the water. The time between charging cycles depends upon the firmness of the water, the quantity of water used, the size of the system and the capability of the exchange media to eliminate firmness.</p>
<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, enabling air to restore and get in the valve pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
