<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Belleville IL</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these issues.</p>
<p>You need to never put metal, plastic, or glass down your disposal. Oftentimes we find silverware jammed in the disposal and it can be damaging to your system. Keep in mind, the garbage disposal is a convenient way to get rid of plate scrapings and assorted soft foods. If a repair will not remedy the issue, and you need a bathroom or kitchen sink or fixture replacement, we can install your brand-new sink or component, and we can offer guidance on the very best choices to accommodate your specific home or company needs.</p>
