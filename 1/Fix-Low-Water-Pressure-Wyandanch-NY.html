<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>
