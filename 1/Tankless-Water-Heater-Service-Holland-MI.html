<p>A lot of homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the outer finishing of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
