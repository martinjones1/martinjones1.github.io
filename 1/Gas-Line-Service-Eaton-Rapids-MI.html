<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets need to definitely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet should be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>
<p>The toilet takes a really very long time to flush. Here's how it works: During normal operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves-- described as the zone of minimized pressure-- is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve ought to leak, the relief valve is developed to release and open water to the outdoors, guaranteeing backflow never ever takes place.</p>
