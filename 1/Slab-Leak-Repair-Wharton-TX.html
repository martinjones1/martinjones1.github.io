<p>If these combinations aren't successful in unclogging your sink, reach for a common household plunger. If you have a double sink, first seal off the 2nd side with a damp fabric or a stopper. You'll need to develop a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you plan to plunge with adequate water to cover the bell of the plunger.

The backflow defense requirements for these 2 examples would also differ considerably.</p>
