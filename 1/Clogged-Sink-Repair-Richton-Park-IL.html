The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage just for non-health risk or health risk conditions. They need to be installed downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours.

It should likewise be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not permit the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can only protect against back siphonage.</p>
