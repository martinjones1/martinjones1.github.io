Water pressure may fail or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and elsewhere during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and channels, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
