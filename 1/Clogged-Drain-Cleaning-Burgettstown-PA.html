Plus, our patented Directional Flow Screen system helps make sure that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also secure the resin bed, so we don't need to squander space on freeboard" which is the empty area in standard water softeners that permit a churning of resin during regeneration to launch sediment, hardness and dirt.</p>

You'll likewise find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control system outside for setting temperatures and managing the pilot-light valve.</p>
