This typically results in a need for pricey repairs, replacements, or additional maintenance services.</p>
<p>Borax sits in the exact very same household of water softeners as washing soda. Borax is a precipitating water softener and it comes with the very same drawbacks i.e. skin inflammation and accumulation. If either of these disadvantages are inappropriate to you - you'll want to discover what's called a non-precipitating water softener. Turn on the water to fill the toilet tank. Pinch the spring clip and slide the float up or down to set the water level 1 in. below the top of the overflow tube or to the water line marked on the tank.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, however if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>
