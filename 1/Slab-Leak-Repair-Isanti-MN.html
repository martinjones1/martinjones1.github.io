<p>Some producers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself.

<p>During regular operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of decreased pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is developed to open and release water to the exterior. An RPZ will regularly release small amounts of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ must be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and allow adequate drainage.</p>
