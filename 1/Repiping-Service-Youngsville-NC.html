<p>When choosing the appropriate system protection there are a number of considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all situations in the cross-connection world.

The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of sprinkler systems consists of the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire defense system are created to match the risk that exists in the areas they are set up in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be very different, we need to comprehend that the fire defense system for any installation requires to be designed and installed to satisfy that specific threat or need. An aircraft hangar will need an extremely various fire security system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow security requirements for these two examples would also differ considerably.</p>
