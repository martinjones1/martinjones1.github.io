These pipes are primarily in manufacturing, commercial, and commercial settings. Fitters install and repair pipe systems in power plants, along with heating and cooling systems in large office buildings. Steamfitters focus on systems that are designed for the circulation of liquids or gases at high pressure. Other fitters might specialize as sprinklerfitters or gasfitters.</p>
