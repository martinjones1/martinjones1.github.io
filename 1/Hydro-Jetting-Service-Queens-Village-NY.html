<p>Improperly installed gas lines result in gas leaks. Gas leakages are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself project. The gas lines have to be adjusted to the best levels by a certified professional. The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house."

The amount of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>
<p>It might be time to get it changed if your water heater has required several repairs over the last couple of years. A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: due to the fact that the life expectancy of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
