<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
