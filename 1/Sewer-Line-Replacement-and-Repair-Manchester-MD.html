<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>The irrigation backflow testing season is from May to September. Irrigation backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to guarantee proper backflow prevention is in place to safeguard our drinking water throughout the irrigation season. Denver Water will send a testing tip notification 30 days prior to the annual test is due.</p>
