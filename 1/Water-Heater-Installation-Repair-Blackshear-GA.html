<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Blackshear GA</h3>
<p>In many states, other than Kansas, you are accountable for any gas piping on your property from our gas meter to your house or service. Atmos Energy does not keep the gas lines on your home beyond our meter, this is the same as other energies, such as your electrical circuitry and pipes. When water enters your house from the main supply of water line, it should just ever flow in one direction: into your home.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>

<p>The law also requires annual testing and inspection by a certified tester, and a report submitted to the DEP. Failure to comply can cause penalties and termination of water service.
