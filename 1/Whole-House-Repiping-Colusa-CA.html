<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Colusa CA</h3>
<p>Leaking gas can lead to asphyxiation and hazardous surges. Luckily, commercial gasses, such as the kind a gas stove or heater uses, have a strong odor contributed to them so that leakages can be more easily found by house owners.

<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Cost Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were prompt and very responsive to send me a quote which was very competitive. They were really professional and did an awesome job. I would absolutely call them again for my plumbing requires. Now, if this discoloration only appears when warm water is being utilized, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still an issue that needs to be dealt with right away (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
