<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab.

Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a complete repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>
