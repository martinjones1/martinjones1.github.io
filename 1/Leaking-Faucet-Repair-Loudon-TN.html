However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a regular occurrence, but it does occur more frequently than you think! Typically it happens during the night when you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical cause of backflow. Fire engine utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>

In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, enabling air to bring back and get in the valve pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement.
