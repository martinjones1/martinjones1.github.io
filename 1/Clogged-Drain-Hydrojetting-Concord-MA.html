<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Concord MA</h3>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line clogs are not something a property owner can fix. This kind of clog requires a professional plumber or drain technician to utilize a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to repair the drain and identify problem. This kind of camera is particularly helpful in finding an issue if you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic tank.</p>
