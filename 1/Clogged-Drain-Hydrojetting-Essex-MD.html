<p>To identify which toilet valve is causing the trouble, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into the tube, there's a problem with the toilet fill valve.

We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water spots and corrosion. But don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
