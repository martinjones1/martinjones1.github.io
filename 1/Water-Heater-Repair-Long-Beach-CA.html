<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back against the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health hazard if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for effectiveness, as well as examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
