<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, UPC model code requires stand-alone residential systems using non-potable piping materials to attain the same level of protection as a commercial system. When chemicals are included to a fire protection system supplied by a safe and clean water supply, increased defense is also required. If you have kids, remind them to avoid holding on any visible pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter. Holding on a pipeline might trigger it to come loose or break, releasing gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter need to be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly available in an emergency.</p>
