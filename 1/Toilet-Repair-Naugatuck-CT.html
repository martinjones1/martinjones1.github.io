<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Naugatuck CT</h3>
<p>The most effective method to resolve hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Other pipe repair strategies include our Pipe Pull method and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull technique interchanges harmed sewer or water lines with new piping by the use of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into location. All new replacement pipes have a predicted life expectancy of one hundred years and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another efficient strategy is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically eliminates the need for broken pipe elimination. By placing a hardening lining material which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a brand-new pipe is produced inside the broken one.</p>
