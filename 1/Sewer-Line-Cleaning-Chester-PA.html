<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Chester PA</h3>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line clogs are not something a house owner can fix. This kind of clog requires a professional plumber or drain professional to utilize a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can make use of a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this kind of camera to repair the drain and identify issue. This type of camera is specifically helpful in locating a problem if you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic tank.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as tough water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
