That sluggish, continuous outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing entirely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water stains and corrosion.
