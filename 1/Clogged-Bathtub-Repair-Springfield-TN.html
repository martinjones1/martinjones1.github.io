<p>DCVs are specifically developed to avoid backflow in fire sprinkler systems.

<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so just softened water goes through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills with firmness ions, it should be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is generally used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
