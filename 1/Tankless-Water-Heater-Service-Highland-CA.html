<p>What is tough water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains substantial quantities of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather an annoyance-- for its lots of designated uses around your house.</p>
