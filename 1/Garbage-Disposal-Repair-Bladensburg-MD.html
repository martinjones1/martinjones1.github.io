<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just put some media inside a tank and expect the best is normal in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can achieve this.</p>
