<p>Covert water leaks are typically demanding and have Potentially Serious Consequences. Replacing your flapper might need slightly different steps than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube.

To find a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, however possibilities are you'll find one of the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
