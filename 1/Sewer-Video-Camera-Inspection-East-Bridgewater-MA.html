<p>If you need a water softener is a personal preference, figuring out. A permit is not required for repairs which involve just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided alterations are not made in the existing piping or components. A typical water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, wide salt water tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a neighboring drain or drywell.</p>
