Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom.
