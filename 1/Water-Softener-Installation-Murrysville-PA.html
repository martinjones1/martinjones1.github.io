<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
