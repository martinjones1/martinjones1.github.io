<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX.

Finally, chlorinated water has actually been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these concerns.</p>
<p>You'll need a special disposal if you home utilizes a septic system and drain field.
