<p>Lots of bad things are being stated on this post about liners. I find that many old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no idea on what they are saying. Will likewise state something does not work well just since they don't like the technology and not due to the fact that it doesn't work. If this heater is installed in a house with numerous bathrooms, the piping procedure adds to the installation expenses.</p>
<p>Say you decide to go that route. The next concern is whether or not you can install it yourself. Put it this way, if you're a skilled handy individual, but you have actually never ever handled this particular repair, you can probably do it, supplying you do your research. I would fix a limit at trying to install a power-vented gas-fired hot water heater (and some other specialized designs). Their installation must be managed by a licensed mechanical or plumbing contractor.</p>
