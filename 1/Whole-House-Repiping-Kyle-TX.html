<p>New homes developed with copper pipes are specifically susceptible to corrosive water conditions due to the fact that the copper pipes have actually not had a chance to become layered within. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new house for a period of three to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Numerous brand-new homes are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>
