We carry out gas line repair and installation services to houses in the Arlington Heights, IL area. Each team member is capable and trained of safely carrying out gas line services.</p>

<p>Since the copper pipes have not had a possibility to become coated within, New houses developed with copper pipes are particularly prone to corrosive water conditions. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a duration of three to five months after occupancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Many new homes are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>

<p>Water isn't hot enough. This can be discouraging since you may bear with it for weeks and even months before deciding it needs to be fixed. Thankfully it's typically a quickly, simple fix. We see this a lot on traditional electrical hot water heater, which use a pair of electrical heating aspects to warm the tank. Typically, one of the two burns out, leading to water that's not hot but warm. We can replace it or diagnose the true issue if this isn't it.</p>
<p>Place the epoxy on the gas line. It is important to follow the application treatment detailed in the bundle. Leave it in, preferably overnight, for it to treat and hold firmly.

<p>Drain pipe is not protected using the needed solvent cement (end of the pipe must be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not actually glued in the routine sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is really a solvent that melts the surface areas of the pipe and fitting for a couple of seconds.
