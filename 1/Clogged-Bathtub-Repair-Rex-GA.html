Gas tank units utilize nearly 50% less energy, costing less to run, than the electrical variety. Nevertheless, they cost a bit more than electric designs.

<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
