Reattach the fuel lines to the carburetor in the same positions as they were initially placed. Reconnect the spark plug wire. A gas line will initially need to be run from the street to the house, a meter installed, followed by gas lines installed inside the home from the meter to the brand-new home appliances. Costs can vary drastically based upon the complexity of the install, and what size pipe and connections each home appliance requires.</p>
<p>Step 6: To connect the drain, place the gasket in the discharge outlet. Then connect the discharge tube with the flange and bolts. Now hang the disposal by lining up the three tabs with the installing ring. Utilize the included wrench to turn and lock the tabs over the ridges. Then link the dishwasher drain.
