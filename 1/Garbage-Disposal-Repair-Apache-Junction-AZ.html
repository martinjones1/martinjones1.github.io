<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
