<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the drinkable system providing the make-up water, backpressure is created. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Possible impurities can then get in the potable water system. The best way to minimize accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of when a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is specifically hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more often.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the perpetrator. But not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack ideal.</p>
