<p>After showing up after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but declared they would not take responsibility if it dripped now because of some undefined oddities in how my sink was put together. After they gave me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, considering that I never ever want to see this company again.</p>
