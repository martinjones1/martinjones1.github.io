<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation instructions within a piping system that is brought on by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When tough water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is usually used in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
