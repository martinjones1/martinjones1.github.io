To find an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, however chances are you'll locate among the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>

<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, but how do they work and which designs are best for specific applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are defined by environmental regulations and local statutes. Local building codes for instance will need a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air gap between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any possible siphon before it can occur, preventing contaminating water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more sophisticated and complex backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical devices installed to prevent backflow variety from the relatively basic to the complex and extremely sophisticated.</p>
