<p>When the information collected from the field test indicates the assembly has actually broken down in its performance listed below the established minimum standard, backflow preventers need to just be repaired. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer need to be repaired or if needed, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working requirements. This means the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
