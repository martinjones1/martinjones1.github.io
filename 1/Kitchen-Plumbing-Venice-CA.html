<p>One of the most severe hot water heater problems is leaking water, which is in some cases triggered by malfunctioning temperature and pressure (T&P) relief valves. If the leak is triggered by deterioration in the water tank, however, you'll likely need to replace the water heater. On this page are numerous Hyperlinks to help you in doing business with the City of Buffalo's Department of License and Inspection Services.</p>
<p>Gas lines featured outer covers that are mostly made from plastic. Remove them to expose the gas pipes beneath. Put on a gas mask considering that breathing in such gases is dangerous for your respiratory system. Make certain to use gloves also.
