<p>The heating component is taking longer to warm the water than it should if the water feels warm. However this specific issue is when you have no hot water streaming in your home. The reasons for this can range from leakages, malfunctioning or defective electrical circuitry, or a broken heating element or thermostat. If it is one of the mentioned concerns, a repair or replacement of the parts may be adequate. However, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems occurring often, then a hot water heater replacement is essential.</p>
<p>If you see rust just in your warm water, then examine the status of your water heater's anode rod. If you've never ever done this on your own, you might need a professional to do this. The rust is most likely coming from the inside of your water heater if the anode rod is rusted out. Replace your hot water heater as quickly as possible if this is the case. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your cold and hot water taps, you more than likely have worn away piping.</p>
