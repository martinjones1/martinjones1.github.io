Install a hair stopper in your shower drain - The primary factor our Tewksbury drain cleaning experts are called into a house is for hair in the shower drain. Installing a hair stopper is inexpensive and simple and will save you from the constant need of drain cleaning.</p>
<p>If there's an existing disposal, use the handy self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. A number of homes in my area being repiped and have talked to neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Obviously it begins with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can trigger major damage if the leak isn't identified soon.</p>
