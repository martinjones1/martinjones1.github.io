<p>At the top of the old disposer, put a screwdriver or the wrenchette" into the ideal side of among the lugs in the mounting ring. While holding the bottom of the disposal with the other hand, rotate the mounting ring counterclockwise to launch the disposal. Understand that the disposal may contain water and food waste, so bring it outside right-side up.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
