<p>Our licensed plumbing professionals can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by linking a hose to drain the tank to an appropriate drain. Flushing the water heating tank ought to be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might offer a fast fix in the short-term, it can trigger much more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run. A great place to start trying to find the leaking kitchen sink plumbing unit is underneath the puddle of water or where you seem to feel the wetness most.</p>

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and figure out the cause of the problem. The line was plainly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
