<p>After showing up after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen tossed up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but declared they would not take responsibility if it leaked now because of some undefined oddities in how my sink was assembled. After they offered me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, because I never ever wish to see this company again.</p>
