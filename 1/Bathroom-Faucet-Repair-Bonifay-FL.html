When your water lines are repiped, it just suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing significant and frequent leaks. We discover that repiping can actually be the more affordable and much better long-lasting service if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
<p>If your water heater has actually needed multiple repairs over the last couple of years, it might be time to get it replaced. A good guideline for hot water heater is this: since the life-span of the average hot water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. If the cost of a repair is over half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your water heater.</p>

Cleaners need to be used according to maker instructions to prevent contamination.</p>
