<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mainly time associated. If whatever is prepared, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or two of time.

A lot of plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with a lot of disposal installations running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor costs roughly $150.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the very best is common in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
