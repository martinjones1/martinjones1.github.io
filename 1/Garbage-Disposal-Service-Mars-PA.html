Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
