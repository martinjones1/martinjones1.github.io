<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it includes. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your house. When the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is generally used in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>

<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair La Vernia TX</h3>
<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is adversely charged and has area to hang on to favorable ions. The fresh media begins by hanging on to the weaker charged salt ions. As hard water travels through your water softener tank, the more powerful charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Because the firmness minerals have a higher positive charge than the sodium, they will knock the salt ions off and take their place.</p>
<p>Absolutely nothing can offer a home soft water like a water softener. And the advantages of treating that water even with a water softener far out weigh the damages caused by our very tough water. If you like the way the water feels, you do not consume water from it unless you use a reverse osmosis system, and you take pleasure in all the other benefits of the soft water and do not mind the hassle of salt bags and inspecting changing the anode rod more regularly then a standard water softener is ideal for you.</p>
