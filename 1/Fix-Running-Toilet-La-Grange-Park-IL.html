<p>We had an excellent experience with Joe Boyette, he was really professional, considerate, qualified. We had a lot of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month period. We also needed to replace a water and a bathroom heater unassociated to the fire, however we felt great in Joe's abilities. We decided to stick with Joe, even though we felt Mr Rooter rates were absolutely on the high end. This being posted by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>

<h3>How To Deal With A Plumbing Emergency La Grange Park IL</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>To figure out if your home is a poly home," begin with the exterior. Underground water pipe are usually blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Frequently, it gets in the home near the water heater. Your main shut down is attached to the end of the water main. Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
