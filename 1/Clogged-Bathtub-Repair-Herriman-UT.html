<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
