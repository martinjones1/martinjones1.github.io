<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has frequently been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mostly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening simply removes firmness minerals and gets rid of problems that are an annoyance and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers individual choice not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this choice a significant one.</p>

<p>Renovation plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
