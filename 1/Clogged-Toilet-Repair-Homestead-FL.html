<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the very first most apparent indications of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple issue such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a larger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent serious damage to your house. Even if the issue stems with the community system, it's still smart to generate the experts to limit the damage to your home.</p>
<p>Softeners primarily remove calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are typically described as 'solidity minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they ought to be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a big red flag that something more severe is wrong with them.</p>
<p>The key to plumbing system longevity is regular maintenance. If you've never had your kitchen sink plumbing had a look at or your drains cleaned up, then it may be time to do so.
