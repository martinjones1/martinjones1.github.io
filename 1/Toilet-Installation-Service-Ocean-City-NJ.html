The brine option should be blended and saved in the salt water tank. Periodic blocking of the resin likewise requires special attention.

If not, gradually stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help separate the product. Likewise, fungis and bacteria also form mats in the resin that decrease its effectiveness. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these nuisances. However, check out the maker's instructions before including any chemicals to the system.</p>

Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, however if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
