<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>

<p>Some plumbers charge more for their services than others, however that's usually a sign of their quality. Typically speaking, more knowledgeable plumbers will charge more for their services.
