<p>Atmospheric vacuum breakers (AVB) are the easiest style of backflow preventer. If you have less than six control valves, they are the least expensive, but also the least reliable alternative. These gadgets are not designed as a whole-system backflow prevention valve; one must be installed at every control valve. Sprinkler Storage facility does not recommend AVB's for waterings systems where there is a prospective to contaminate drinking water. When one has actually failed, avb's are not testable and it is not possible to identify.</p>

New meters should fulfill regulations and code requirements for their placement, and gas companies might need an unique meter for their services, limiting your choices.
