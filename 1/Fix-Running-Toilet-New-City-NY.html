<p>Repiping is not a temporary fix. It's a long-term service for the whole plumbing system in your home or business. We turn off the supply of water, get rid of old pipe and replace it with new pipe.

<p>Conventional tank-type water heaters consist of steel cylinders that are fed by a water pipe that dips into a big storage tank. The water inside this tank is warmed up and then launched into the pipes of your house through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank consists of the temperature and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you exceed a preset level. You'll also discover a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control system outside for setting temperature levels and controlling the pilot-light valve.</p>
