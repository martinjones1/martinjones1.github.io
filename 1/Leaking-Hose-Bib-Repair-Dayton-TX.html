<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
