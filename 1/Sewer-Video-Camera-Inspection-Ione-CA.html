<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are set up in areas where water might trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
