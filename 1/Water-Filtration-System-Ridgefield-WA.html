Flushing the water heating tank ought to be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might provide a fast fix in the short term, it can trigger even more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.

Leaking faucets such as shower valves, tub faucets and sink faucets do not get replaced when repiped.</p>
<p>Whether you're updating your sink set up during a kitchen remodel, or just trying to replace an impossible-to-repair and old unit, a professional with experience setting up garbage disposals can assist.
