Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and avenues, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
