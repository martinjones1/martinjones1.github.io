<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Spartanburg SC</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
