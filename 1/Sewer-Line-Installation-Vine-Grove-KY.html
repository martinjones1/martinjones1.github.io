<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>

<h3>Most Effective Drain Cleaning Methods Vine Grove KY</h3>
<p>This is especially common after returning from a vacation or not utilizing your house's supply of water for an extended time period. If this takes place just when your hot water is running, it might be due to a corroded warm water heater and not the plumbing pipes in your house. We have a devoted team of knowledgeable, highly-skilled, and professional plumbers who are at the helm of repairing all kinds of sinks.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
