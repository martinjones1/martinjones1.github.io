<p>Rust: The most common issue is deterioration in the tank and pipes that connect to your hot water heater. This is specifically true if you have neglected tough water, which consists of harsh minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the material in time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another element that is triggering the corrosion, you will ultimately experience a leak in your water heater that is challenging to repair. Leaks frequently imply a brand-new system replacement is in order.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
