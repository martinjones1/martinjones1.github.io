<h3>Helpful Tips For Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Woodbury CT</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause thousands of dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel method off schedule. So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers handle all types of work. Their responsibilities break out into two classifications: Plumbers who manage fundamental repairs (frequently in emergency situations), and plumbers who specialize in remodeling additions and projects.</p>

<p>Find out if there are any lead pipes in the home. Homes that were developed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how helpful, is an ecological toxin (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have kids, you might not want to live in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and determine the cause of the issue. The line was clearly deteriorating; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
