<p>In many cases, the toilet can be fixed rather than replaced, considering that the issue often boils down to a single element or two.

<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in Chalfont PA</h3>
<p>In water circulation systems, water is usually preserved at a significant pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may stop working or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Most house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
