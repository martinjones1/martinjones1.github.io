<p>IRWD is devoted to providing safe, high quality water to consumers. Our comprehensive water quality program runs 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water provided to our consumers is kept devoid of hazardous impurities. A fundamental part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices including a nonpotable compound, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination might happen when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or cooling and heating system, into the safe and clean water system. This can happen through a process called backflow.</p>

These leakages are extremely inefficient, as more than a hundred gallons of water wind up traveling through the overflow.</p>
