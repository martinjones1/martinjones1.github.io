<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain.
