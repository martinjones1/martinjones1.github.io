<h3>Leaking Toilet in Quakertown Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had actually backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least 3 attempts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his knowledge and experience he figured out that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the particles decreased the newly cleaned main drain.

Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
