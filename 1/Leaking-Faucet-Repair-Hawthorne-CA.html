I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
