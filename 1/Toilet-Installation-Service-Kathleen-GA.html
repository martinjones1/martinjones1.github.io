I was prepared to spend a minimum of $500 for a warm water system and he stated it wasn't necessary!!!! He could have set up the system and I 'd never have actually known the distinction. That's a quality service. . Installing a garbage disposal is a fairly easy task for a knowledgeable do-it-yourselfer. Grab a few standard tools and follow our how-to.</p>
