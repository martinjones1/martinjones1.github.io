<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to inspect the line and identify the reason for the problem. The line was plainly deteriorating; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line could collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
