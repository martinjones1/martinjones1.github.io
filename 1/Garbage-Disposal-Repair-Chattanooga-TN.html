<p>After arriving after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after among the two gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but declared they wouldn't take duty if it dripped now since of some unspecified quirks in how my sink was put together.

I actually received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
