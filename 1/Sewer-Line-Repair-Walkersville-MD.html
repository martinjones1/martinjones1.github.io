<p>Great deals of bad things are being said on this post about liners. I find that lots of old time plumbers are not informed on liners and have no clue on what they are stating.

Companies like restaurants or major hotels that depend on a completely functioning garage disposal will likewise suffer if the scenario is not properly addressed.
