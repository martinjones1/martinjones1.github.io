While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather an annoyance-- for its lots of intended uses around your house.</p>
<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if applicable). If your unit is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make sure your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the new system in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pressed versus it will result in decapitation, it might frighten a couple of years off your life. Not that I would know from experience.</p>
