<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>

<h3>How to Repair Kitchen Faucets in Strongsville OH</h3>
<p>Anti-Scale Devices: Some hot water heater promote functions that reduce mineral scale buildup by churning water in the bottom of the tank. Features such as these add cost, and aren't that efficient. Your best method is to get the hot water heater with the 12 year guarantee.
