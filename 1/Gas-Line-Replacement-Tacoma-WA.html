<p>After showing up after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but claimed they wouldn't take responsibility if it leaked now because of some unspecified quirks in how my sink was assembled. After they provided me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, considering that I never ever wish to see this company once again.</p>
