<p>2 designs of PVBs are readily available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and an independently acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. A PVB might be used to separate health or non-health risks but is effective versus back-siphonage only.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another factor to consider. While you can acquire designs with special features that do everything but include the salt, you will pay for each extra function. The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm guarantee that the unique function will not stop working. Depending on the water source, you may have to filter turbid water or disinfect bacteria-laden water-all prior to it even reaches the softening unit. Finally, if you own a septic tank, you need to think about the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates show that about 50 gallons of water are utilized for each regeneration cycle. This might or might not cause hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>
