Local building regulations for instance will need a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air gap in between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any possible siphon before it can happen, preventing infecting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more complex and sophisticated backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical devices installed to avoid backflow range from the reasonably easy to the extremely sophisticated and complex.</p>
