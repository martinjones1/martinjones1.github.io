Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
