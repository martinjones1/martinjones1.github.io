Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
