<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
