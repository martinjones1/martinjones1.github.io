<p>Rust is an intricate phenomenon and there are numerous aspects that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that speed up rust Likewise, there is an absence of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of deterioration control. Thus, considering all these factors, in addition to arise from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
