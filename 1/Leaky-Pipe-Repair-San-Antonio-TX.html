In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can significantly restrict the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
