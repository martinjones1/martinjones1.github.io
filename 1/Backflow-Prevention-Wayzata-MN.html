<p>You'll discover that water runs to fill up the bowl Whenever you flush your toilet. However, in a correctly working toilet, the water must stop running as soon as the bowl is filled to its suitable capability. Chances are you have an internal leak and water is being disposed down the overflow if your toilet continues to run. These leakages are very wasteful, as more than a hundred gallons of water end up taking a trip through the overflow.</p>
