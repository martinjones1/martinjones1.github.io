<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets need to absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural stability of the home.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a serious public health danger if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies installed.

<p>It may be time to get it replaced if your water heater has actually needed several repairs over the last couple of years. An excellent rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the typical hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. If the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your water heater.</p>
