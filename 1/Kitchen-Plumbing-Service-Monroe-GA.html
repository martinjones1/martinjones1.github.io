<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Monroe GA</h3>
<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are many aspects that accelerate rust in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that speed up rust Likewise, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of corrosion control. Hence, thinking about all these factors, as well as arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
