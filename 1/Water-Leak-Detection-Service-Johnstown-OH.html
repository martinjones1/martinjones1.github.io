The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm guarantee that the special function will not stop working. Depending on the water source, you might need to filter turbid water or disinfect bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening system.

Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can achieve this.</p>
