The material has highly established structure of pores on the surface area of which are sites with quickly caught and released ions. This procedure of trapping of ions occurs with a simultaneous releasing of other ions leading to the term ion-exchange. Ion exchange resins can be produced to selectively choose one, or possibly a number of different kinds of ions. Usually, these resins are based upon cross-linked polystyrene.</p>

Toilet continues to run - Either fill device has stopped working to shutoff or is out of modification sending out water into the bowl. Toilet flapper is worn out and no longer sealing water from going into bowl.</p>
<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Softeners generally remove calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are typically described as 'hardness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they ought to be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a substantial warning that something more serious is wrong with them.</p>
