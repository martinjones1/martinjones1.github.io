<p>A water softener works by using electrical charges to get rid of the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals carry positive charges, so water softeners use salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with potable water, you are needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, drinkable and watering, you are also required to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

<p>New homes developed with copper pipes are particularly prone to corrosive water conditions due to the fact that the copper pipes have actually not had an opportunity to end up being coated inside. As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new home for a period of three to five months after occupancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of brand-new homes are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>

This can force the potable water to reverse its instructions of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Potential contaminants can then go into the safe and clean water system. The best method to reduce build-up is have a professional flush it at least when a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly tough with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>
