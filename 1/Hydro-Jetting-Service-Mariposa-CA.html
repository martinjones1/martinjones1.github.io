Depending upon the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather an annoyance-- for its lots of intended uses around your house.</p>
