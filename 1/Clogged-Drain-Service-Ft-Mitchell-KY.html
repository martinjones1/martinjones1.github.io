Scale builds up in your pipes, blocking them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale considerably shortens the life-span of devices like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice devices. Difficult water destroys hot water home appliances. The higher the temperature of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will harden and strengthen into strong deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>
