<p>Another common misperception is that calcium-carbonate scale is an effective type of corrosion control. There is an absence of clinical evidence supporting this claim, nevertheless. Scale does not form in consistent homogeneous layers that would protect pipe from deterioration Scale can be soft or permeable and is highly irregular. Corrosion can still happen under conditions that are favorable to the formation of hard-water scale or perhaps when hard-water scale is already present.</p>

You can try to break up the clog yourself first before calling a professional if you have a manual snake. Backflow is the unfavorable reversal of flow of nonpotable water or other substances through a cross-connection and into the piping of a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system.
