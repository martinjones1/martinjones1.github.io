<p>Once the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut down remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>
