<p>. Backflow into a public water system can infect the water or pollute in that system (i.e., backflow into a public water system can make the water in that system unusable or unsafe to drink), and each water provider has an obligation to offer water that is usable and safe to drink under all foreseeable situations. Furthermore, customers normally have absolute faith that water provided to them through a public water system is constantly safe to drink. For these factors, your water district need to take safety measures to safeguard its public water supply versus backflow.</p>
