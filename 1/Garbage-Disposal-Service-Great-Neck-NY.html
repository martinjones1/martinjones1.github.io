The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely used in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century.
