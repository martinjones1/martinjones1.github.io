After we have actually cleaned up the body, and the fixed elements are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or particles. This can be difficult, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be wallowed.
