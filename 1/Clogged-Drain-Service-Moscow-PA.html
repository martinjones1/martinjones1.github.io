If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to trickle into the bowl. That slow, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing completely. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water stains and rust.
