<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually frequently been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure.

But the reality is that water softening simply eliminates hardness minerals and removes problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not need. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
