When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released.
