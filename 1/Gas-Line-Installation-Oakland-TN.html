<p>However, because a garbage disposal is only anticipated to last between 10 to 12 years, a replacement will eventually be required.

<p>Nevertheless, UPC design code requires stand-alone residential systems using non-potable piping products to attain the same level of defense as a commercial system. When chemicals are added to a fire security system provided by a potable water supply, increased protection is also needed.
