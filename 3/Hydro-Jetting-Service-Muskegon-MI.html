<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. Gradually, like any other appliance in your home, your waste disposal unit. might require repairs.

You'll need to develop a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you intend to plunge with adequate water to cover the bell of the plunger. Place the plunger securely over the drain and plunge intensely numerous times. When you hear the suction clear the clog, remove the plunger and flush the drain well with warm water.</p>
