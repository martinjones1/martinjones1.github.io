<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back against the required direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. There is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health hazard if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for effectiveness, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
