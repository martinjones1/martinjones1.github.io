<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leakages occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these issues.</p>
