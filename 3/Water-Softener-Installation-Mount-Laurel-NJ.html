Our substantial water quality program runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water provided to our consumers is kept devoid of harmful impurities.

Contamination might happen when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or cooling and heating system, into the safe and clean water system. This can occur through a process called backflow.</p>
