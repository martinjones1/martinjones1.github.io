<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed.
