<p>To determine which toilet valve is triggering the problem, look at the overflow tube. If water is overflowing into television, there's a problem with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is listed below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, continuous outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing completely. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water spots and rust.
