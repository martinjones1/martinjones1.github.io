<p>Most homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the outer covering of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>To get rid of the cord from the old disposer, utilize a screwdriver to get rid of the plate covering the electrical connections at the bottom of the system. Disconnect the wire nuts and pull the cord through the cover plate hole. For preventive maintenance, Larry & Sons provides annual checkups on your sewer and septic systems. Our technicians carefully inspect your entire drainage system with video camera pipe inspection to prevent future problems before they occur.
