<p>The most reliable way to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Small leaks should never ever be disregarded, as they can show that a bigger issue is present.
