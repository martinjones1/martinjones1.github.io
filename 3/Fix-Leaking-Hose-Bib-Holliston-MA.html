Backsiphonage is backflow brought on by a negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system.

<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that manages water circulation in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't installed effectively, you may experience an often or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in lost water.</p>

Hence, thinking about all these aspects, in addition to arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
