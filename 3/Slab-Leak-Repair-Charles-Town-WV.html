<p>Both irrigation water and clean water supply are at high risk of entering contact with toxins due to backflows. Numerous faucets can have a low-flow aerator set up at the outlet end of the water spout. Aerators are designed to control water flow from faucets by introducing air into the water as it streams from the spout. Including air in this method preserves consistent water pressure, which triggers the component to use less water.</p>

Hidden sets of pipes utilize pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet.
