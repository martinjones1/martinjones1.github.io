<p>Softeners primarily eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are often referred to as 'firmness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they ought to be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a substantial warning that something more severe is incorrect with them.</p>
<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and avoid it from working. This is referred to as fouling. Sometimes it may be necessary to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. If the resin becomes fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Cleaners need to be utilized according to producer instructions to avoid contamination.</p>
