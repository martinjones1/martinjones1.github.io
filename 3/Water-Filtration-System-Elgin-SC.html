<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively working together that you can achieve this.</p>
