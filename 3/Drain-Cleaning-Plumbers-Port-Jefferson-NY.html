After we have actually cleaned up the body, and the fixed components are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be tricky, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is very important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be used to assure the line is properly flushed.</p>
