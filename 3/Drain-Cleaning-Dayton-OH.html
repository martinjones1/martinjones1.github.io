<p>When pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the safe and clean system supplying the cosmetics water, backpressure is created. This can require the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Potential pollutants can then get in the safe and clean water supply. The best way to minimize build-up is have a professional flush it at least once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially tough with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater regularly.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capability and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth instantly starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regrowth usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
