<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
