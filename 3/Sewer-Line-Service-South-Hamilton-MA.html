<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General. Within the building envelope consisting of below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a component, sub-system, or system group is changed, an authorization and inspection shall not be needed. If so wanted, this will not preclude the licensee from getting permits and inspections for such work.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is a sudden reduction in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as during fire fighting or when a water main breaks. At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This reversal can produce a suction effect and draw prospective contaminants into the potable (drinking) water system. Storage tank water heaters are frequently found in a lot of homes. Their elements are an insulated tank, generally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water up until it's required. A pipe emerges from the leading to deliver warm water to its destination, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
<p>Other signs you may need to repipe include rust in your supply of water, low water pressure, and damp areas in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these prevail indications that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily imply repiping is the only service. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will have a look at the issue to identify the best strategy.</p>
