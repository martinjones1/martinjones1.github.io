<p>Woodbury, in addition to numerous other communities and organizations, has found the very best method to prevent these spots from taking place is by reducing the variety of times your water softener regrows. "Regenerating" describes the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "tired" or full. However, lots of water softeners regenerate frequently, when the filter medium truly isn't full. This can be corrected by merely resetting your water softener to remove less hardness or to run longer in between regrowth cycles.</p>
