<p>Your Local Plumbing, Heating & Cooling Specialists Since 1938. Polyproylene is made of a thermoplastic polymer. This type of piping is also typically utilized to consist of gas in the pipe, however it is not the preferred product for conveying gas. Copper is an older product that is the least preferred. Considering that copper is highly conductive, this is not a wanted quality of natural gas piping. Copper is also not flexible and more favorable to gas leaks. We try to avoid using this material, however will offer copper repiping services if required.</p>
<p>You want to save water. Older toilets use up to seven gallons of water per flush and are much less water-efficient than newer models.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
<p>Metal alloys are vulnerable to an electro-chemical condition called deterioration. Rust can literally consume a metal away triggering the metal to not be as strong as it originally was or alter the tolerances causing parts to not work in a backflow preventer.
