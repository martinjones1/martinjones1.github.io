<p>In some cases, our service technicians will recommend that you replace your hot water heater instead of invest in repairs.

<p>A house's service line (also called a sewer lateral) runs from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the homeowner is accountable for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by constantly bringing tanks off-line and online in reaction to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, only one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
