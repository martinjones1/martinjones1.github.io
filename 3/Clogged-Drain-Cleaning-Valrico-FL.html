<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

Hence, thinking about all these elements, along with results from research studies, WQA's position is that a properly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
