<p>Backflow preventers should just be fixed when the data gathered from the field test shows the assembly has actually deteriorated in its performance listed below the developed minimum basic. The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if required, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
