Repiping installers first choose the products to utilize for the task.

If you find a leak and select a patching task instead of a repiping task, simply remember that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the same product and they might be next. To prevent further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to think about repiping your entire home when you identify a leak.</p>
