I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
