No matter what type of water heater you have or are interested in, the specialists at Timothy Off can help. Contact us today for our water heater installation services. For example, if your kitchen sink is backed up due to the fact that you flushed potato peels down the disposal, a quick drain snaking can break up the clog and send it down the pipes.

Initially, these small deposits are safe, but gradually they build up and eventually clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically restrict the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
