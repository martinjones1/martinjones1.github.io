<p>If your water heater has needed multiple repairs over the last few years, it might be time to get it replaced. An excellent guideline for water heaters is this: due to the fact that the life expectancy of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. If the cost of a repair is over half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater.</p>
<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and avoid it from working. This is referred to as fouling. Sometimes it may be required to filter the water before it gets to your softener to avoid fouling. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin becomes fouled. Cleaners need to be used according to maker instructions to prevent contamination.</p>
