<p>Backflow preventers are crucial for creating a safe water supply system. No matter which design you select, all water softeners need to be appropriately maintained. The brine service should be mixed and kept in the salt water tank. Regular obstructing of the resin likewise needs special attention. For instance, if the raw supply of water is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, regular backwashing with water will resolve this problem. If not, slowly stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help break up the material. Likewise, fungi and bacteria likewise form mats in the resin that lower its effectiveness.
