<p>To figure out which toilet valve is causing the problem, take a look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overflowing into the tube. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, constant outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing completely. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water stains and rust. But do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
