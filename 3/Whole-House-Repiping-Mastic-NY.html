<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
