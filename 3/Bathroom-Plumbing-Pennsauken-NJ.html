<p>Root Invasion: Root invasion describes what occurs when tree roots begin to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This takes place because the wetness in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots eventually do piece your drain lines, they can cause blockages, breaks, and back-ups which might result in extensive home damage. Look out for damp, green spots in your lawn, a consistent sewage odor in or around your house, an uptick in rodent and insect activity, and slow drains, as these are all common indications of root intrusion.</p>
