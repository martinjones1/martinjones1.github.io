<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is typical in our market and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
