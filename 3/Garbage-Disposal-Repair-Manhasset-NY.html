<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can buy models with unique features that do whatever but include the salt, you will pay for each additional function. The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm warranty that the unique function will not fail. Depending upon the water source, you may have to filter turbid water or disinfect bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening unit. Finally, if you own a septic tank, you should think about the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regeneration. Estimates indicate that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regeneration cycle. This may or might not cause hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>
