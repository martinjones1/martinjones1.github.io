<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
