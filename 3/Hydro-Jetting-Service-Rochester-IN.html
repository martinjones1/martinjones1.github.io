<p>Backflow preventers are important for creating a safe water system system. No matter which model you choose, all water softeners need to be effectively preserved. The brine option must be mixed and stored in the brine tank. Regular blocking of the resin likewise requires unique attention.

If not, gradually stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Also, germs and fungi also form mats in the resin that lower its efficiency. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these annoyances. However, check out the producer's instructions prior to adding any chemicals to the system.</p>
