<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal preference. An authorization is not needed for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided modifications are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A typical water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, large brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line.
