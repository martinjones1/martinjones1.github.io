<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic system from your house. When you experience obstructions in numerous drains simultaneously in your home, then that usually suggests that your main sewer line is supporting. This can happen in multiple locations and any mix of drains. For example, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all link, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>
