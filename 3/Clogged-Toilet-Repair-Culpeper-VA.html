<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Culpeper VA</h3>
<p>Zurn Industries: In addition to supplying a comprehensive line of backflow preventers, most of Zurn Wilkins' plumbing fixtures fulfill and go beyond the requirements established by the Safe Drinking Water Act and lead-free initiative. Recent modifications to the Safe Drinking Water Act mandated that all commercial plumbing fixtures, valves, pipes, and fittings that are directly intended for human water consumption are required to be produced with less than 0.25 percent leaded brass content. Zurn Wilkins plumbing products that fall within this classification have been designated lead-free," implying they are compliant.</p>
<p>Duty for installation falls upon the owner of the co-op or the property or condo board. Owners and boards of structures that are provided an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer must file plans with the DEP within one month. If the DEP has actually not gotten certification from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the procedure of being installed within that time, a Notice of Infraction will be sent out. Violators will be accountable for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 released by the Environmental protection Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can eventually cause civil and criminal procedures and actions, as well as the termination of water service to the structure.</p>
