<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Southlake TX</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
