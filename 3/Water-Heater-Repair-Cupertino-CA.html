<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
