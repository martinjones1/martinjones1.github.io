Things to think about: Batch feed garbage disposals need a bigger in advance cost. Some models run more than double the cost of constant feed systems.

You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
