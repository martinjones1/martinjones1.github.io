Several back-ups usually indicate your sewer system is failing. We advise following up with a total video inspection of the entire system to recognize what is causing the issue and to identify whether it will be a recurring problem.

<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may need to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug kit that I bought independently from the disposal unit. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Throughout installation, electrical power and water are shut down to the area. The old plumbing and sink flange are gotten rid of and cleaned up of any putty. Loosen up the nuts that connect the drain pipe, including the curved trap, at the sink drain and near the wall or floor. Use your hands for PVC connections or a monkey wrench for metal connections. Place a pail below the drain pipe to capture any water that leaks out.</p>
