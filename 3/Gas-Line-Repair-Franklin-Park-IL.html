<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of small, maybe less critical things that can break or deteriorate. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
