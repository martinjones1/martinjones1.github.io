Brooks found just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is heated up straight whenever it's needed. Tankless systems particularly make use of a component that warms up water when the tap is turned on.

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system needs to be constantly kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
