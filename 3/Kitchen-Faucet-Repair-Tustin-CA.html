<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to inspect the line and identify the cause of the problem. The line was clearly degrading; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
