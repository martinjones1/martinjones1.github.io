<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are primarily time associated. If everything is all set, in good condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or more of time. If things need to be customized, changed, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours needed and for that reason the total expenses. Many plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal installations running $50 per hour for 3 hours total, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
