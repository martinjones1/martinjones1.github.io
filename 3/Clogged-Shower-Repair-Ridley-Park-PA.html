<p>Concealed water leaks are frequently demanding and have Possibly Severe Effects. Replacing your flapper may need a little different actions than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To find an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, however possibilities are you'll locate one of the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
<p>Pretty little flappers may get all the glory in the toilet world, but the trip lever is the bridge in between man and machine. After all, if the journey lever does not raise the flapper to flush the toilet, you need to wiggle and jerk and in some cases even stick your hand in there and lift the flapper by hand. And who wishes to do all that work??? In all seriousness though, ensuring your trip lever is working well can conserve you the hassle of those little daily inconveniences - that many people simply cope with and never recognize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to point out the gallons of water lost every day by a poor seal.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the degree of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
