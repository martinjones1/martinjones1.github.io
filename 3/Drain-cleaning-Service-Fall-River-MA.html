I will absolutely use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70.

<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that controls water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't set up properly, you may experience a frequently or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in lost water.</p>

<p>A & frac13; HP or 1/2 HP waste disposal unit unit can grind soft, non-fibrous foods. There is very little insulation in the weaker models.

Aluminum disposals are the most economical, costing about $70 to $150 a pop however are susceptible to deterioration and leaking.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you may have to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug set that I bought independently from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
