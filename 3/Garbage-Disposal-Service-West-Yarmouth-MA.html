<p>When a hard clog is costing you your sanity, make it deal with our Tewksbury drain cleaning professionals. Contact us or call us at (978) 355-1673 to get help today. Toilet continues to run - Either fill device has actually stopped working to shutoff or runs out change sending out water into the bowl. Toilet flapper is broken and no longer sealing water from entering bowl.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers bring only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is typical in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively working together that you can attain this.</p>
