<h3>When To Call A Plumber Worth IL</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
