<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>

<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Guideline, General. Within the building envelope including below grade, if less than 10-percent (small) of the existing piping for a fixture, system, or sub-system  group is changed, a permit and inspection shall not be required.

<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the potable system offering the makeup water, backpressure is created.

Potential impurities can then go into the safe and clean water supply. The best way to reduce accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially difficult with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>
