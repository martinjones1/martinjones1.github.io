<p>As soon as, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, but should then shift to galvanized. I am not exactly sure why that need to be.

While some older houses may not have backflow preventers, all more recent homes are required to have them. Doug's can help you locate and recognize them if you're not sure what kind of backflow preventers are used in your home or organisation. We can also perform your yearly backflow inspections.</p>
