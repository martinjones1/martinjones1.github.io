<p>Offering quality and professional repair, replacement, and installation services for your plumbing. Some jurisdictions likewise permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can significantly limit the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
