<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Rockville IN</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to address hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>If you see rust only in your warm water, then check the status of your hot water heater's anode rod. You may need a professional to do this if you've never done this on your own. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is most likely coming from the inside of your water heater. Replace your hot water heater as soon as possible if this is the case. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your hot and cold water taps, you more than likely have worn away piping.</p>
