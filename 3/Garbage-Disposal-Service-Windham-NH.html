<h3>Windham NH Experts In Unclogging Drains</h3>
<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are lots of elements that speed up rust in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that accelerate rust Likewise, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of corrosion control. Thus, thinking about all these aspects, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>

There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, caused the spread of illness or illness.</p>
