<p>A minimum of once every three months, drain water from the tank. With time sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct efficiency, and draining a gallon or so helps eliminate the sediment. If you identify a leak and opt for a patching job rather of a repiping job, just keep in mind that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the same product and they might be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to think about repiping your whole house when you identify a leak.</p>
