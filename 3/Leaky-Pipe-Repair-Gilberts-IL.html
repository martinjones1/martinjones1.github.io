<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the required instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can become infected. If enabled to re-enter the water system, there is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health hazard. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for efficiency, in addition to examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
