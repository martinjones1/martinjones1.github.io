<p>Backflow preventers are critical for developing a safe water system system. No matter which model you select, all water softeners need to be effectively maintained. The salt water solution need to be mixed and kept in the brine tank. Regular blocking of the resin likewise needs special attention. For instance, if the raw water supply is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Often, regular backwashing with water will resolve this problem. If not, slowly stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help separate the product. Similarly, fungi and germs also form mats in the resin that reduce its effectiveness. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these problems.
