<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Shelton WA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system should be continually kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
