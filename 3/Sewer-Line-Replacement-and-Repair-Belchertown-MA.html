<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
