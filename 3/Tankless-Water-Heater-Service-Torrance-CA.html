<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is heated directly whenever it's needed. When the tap is switched on, tankless systems particularly make usage of a component that heats up water. The water is continuously heated up as long as the tap remains on. If the tap is instantly turned off, the water stops being warmed. The heating temperature level is normally pre-set to suit your needs and preferences. Since they only heat water when required, tankless electrical water heaters utilize less power than conventional water heaters.</p>
