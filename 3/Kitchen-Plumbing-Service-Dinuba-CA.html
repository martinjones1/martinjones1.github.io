<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. An action crew is available for preliminary examination of sewer emergencies every day of the year. If sewage from the City-maintained portion of the sewer system supports through toilets or sinks, call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance personnel at (503) 823-1700.

<p>Every day, the drains in your house efficiently remove big amounts of water and waste. With time, dirt, debris, hair, and countless other little particles can get trapped and build up in your pipes. Ultimately, the water might not have the ability to drain quickly or effectively, and you may experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is constantly supporting. When this takes place, it may be time to contact a professional from Atlas Plumbing to investigate.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your home. When you experience clogs in multiple drains simultaneously in your home, then that generally indicates that your main sewer line is backing up. This can occur in multiple places and any mix of drains. For example, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from several drain lines in your home.</p>
<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
