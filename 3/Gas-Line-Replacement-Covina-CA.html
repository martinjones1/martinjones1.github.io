If your system is getting close to 10 years old, it's generally not a good idea to pay for repairs if they are worth more than 50 percent of the price of a brand-new system. It is recommended that you have the garbage disposal changed if problems become more regular with an older system.

For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will cause a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>

Sometimes it might be needed to filter the water before it gets to your softener to avoid fouling. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin becomes fouled. Cleaners need to be utilized according to producer directions to prevent contamination.</p>
