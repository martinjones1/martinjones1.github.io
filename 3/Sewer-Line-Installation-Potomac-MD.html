All new replacement pipes have a forecasted life-span of one hundred years and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another efficient strategy is pipe relining. Pipe relining essentially gets rid of the need for broken pipe elimination. By inserting a hardening lining material which coats the within the existing pipe, a new pipe is produced inside the broken one.</p>
