<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. With time, like any other appliance in your house, your garbage disposal. might need repairs. A disposal system might start or clog to leak through heavy, or inappropriate, usage. A leak someplace in the system might indicate a used seal. Sometimes, we can replace that seal; otherwise, we'll need to replace the whole system. This is where the UPC really comes into play.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
