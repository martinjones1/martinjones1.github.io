If your toilet was produced prior to 1994, you could be losing cash with every flush. Older toilets use up to 3.5 gallons per flush-- more than double the modern-day standard. A Broken Dip Tube: The dip tube is used to vent all of the fresh water from the water line to the bottom of your tank so that it can warm quicker. If you find that cold water is coming out of your faucet even when you are turning the hot knob, it is most likely that your dip tube is broken.</p>
<p>Action 6: To connect the drain, place the gasket in the discharge outlet. Then attach the discharge tube with the flange and bolts. Now hang the disposal by lining up the three tabs with the mounting ring. Use the included wrench to turn and lock the tabs over the ridges. Then link the dishwasher drain. Make certain the discharge pipe is lined up properly and connect your drains-- use a T-pipe prior to your P-trap.</p>
