<p>A minimum of when every three months, drain water from the tank. In time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can hinder efficiency, and draining pipes a gallon or two helps remove the sediment. If you find a leak and opt for a patching task instead of a repiping task, just remember that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the exact same product and they might be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to think about repiping your entire house when you find a leak.</p>
