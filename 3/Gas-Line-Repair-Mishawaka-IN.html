WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain.

In either case, scalding water threatens and should be right away attended to by an experienced plumbing professional.</p>
