<p>Often called an auger, this convenient tool can clear obstructions that might be stuck further down the system. You'll have to take apart the drain and P-trap that runs below the kitchen sink to expose the stub pipe" or stubout" that takes a trip behind the cabinet wall. This is where you place the snake into the pipe until you feel resistance to separate the clog.</p>
<p>To plumb the disposer's drain outlet, fit the rubber washer over the flanged end of the plastic crosspiece, then slide the metal flange on from the other end. Pointer the bottom of the metal flange into its slot in the disposer and tighten the attaching bolt through the top of the flange.
