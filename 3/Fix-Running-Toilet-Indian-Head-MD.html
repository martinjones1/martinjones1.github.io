<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most prevalent and disastrous water problems: difficult water.  Hard water ruined the modern-day home. Scale builds up in your pipes, obstructing them and reducing water pressure.  Scale dramatically shortens the life expectancy of appliances like dishwashers, coffee makers and ice makers. Difficult water destroys warm water appliances. The higher the temperature of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and solidify into strong deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
