<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures unusable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain effectively or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can assist. In some cases drain repair needs can be fixed relatively rapidly by an experienced handyman. At other times, however, parts of a drain might need to be dismantled, taken a look at, and cleared before being replaced. In some cases, a handyman might figure out that a replacement part is needed (like a reducer, pvc, or tailpiece  trap) to guarantee typical operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman agent today to go over repair options.</p>
