<h3>Prices For Unclogging And Video Inspection Hillsboro MO</h3>
<p>If these mixes aren't successful in unclogging your sink, reach for a typical household plunger. If you have a double sink, first seal the second side with a wet fabric or a stopper. You'll need to create a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you plan to plunge with sufficient water to cover the bell of the plunger.

<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
