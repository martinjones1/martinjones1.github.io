<p>Water softeners come in all shapes and sizes and larger certainly does not indicate better. WaterBoss ® utilizes great mesh resin - smaller sized beads that actually offer more area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to enable optimal capacity in a minimum of space. Plus, our patented Directional Circulation Screen system helps ensure that no resin bead goes unused.

<p>Water heater repair and hot water heater installation are typically postponed as long as possible. A water heater is an expensive plumbing device, and we tend to push off replacing it until it breaks beyond repair. It is also a piece of plumbing equipment that we ignore until we awaken to a cold shower. We may hear the hot water heater making noise, trying to tell us there is a problem, but we overlook it which might lead to a more substantial repair that if we would have nipped it in the bud. It is necessary to go out in front of any problems as fast as possible. The quicker you react to an issue, the better possibility you'll need to conserve time and money on hot water heater services.</p>
