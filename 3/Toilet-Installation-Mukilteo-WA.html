<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and detailed plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping. Plumbing problems aren't just hard to discover, they're also capable of causing some severe damage. Pinhole leakages, for example, are so small that they just release a couple of droplets at a time.
