As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a nuisance-- for its many designated uses around your house.</p>
