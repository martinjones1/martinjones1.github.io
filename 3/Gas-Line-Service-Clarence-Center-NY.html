<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
