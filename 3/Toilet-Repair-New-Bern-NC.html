<p>Difficult water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water passes through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is typically used in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
<p>If you  want to eliminate the salt, merely fill the brine tank with potassium chloride pellets, not salt pellets. The only problem is that potassium chloride is costly: $25 to $30 per 50-pound bag. Salt costs $4 to $6 per bag.

The majority of high-pressure water jetters will operate with up to 4,000 PSI of pressure and will press anywhere from 2-18 gallons of water per minute through a pipe.</p>
