<p>Climatic vacuum breakers (AVB) are the easiest style of backflow preventer. If you have less than 6 control valves, they are the least expensive, but also the least reliable option.

Sprinkler Warehouse does not advise AVB's for irrigations systems where there is a potential to infect drinking water. When one has actually stopped working, avb's are not testable and it is not possible to discover.</p>
