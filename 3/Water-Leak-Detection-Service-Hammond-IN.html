As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite an annoyance-- for its numerous designated uses around your home.</p>
