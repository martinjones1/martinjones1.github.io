After we have actually cleaned up the body, and the fixed elements are still out of the body, and we have finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or debris. This can be tricky, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system needs to be made use of to ensure the line is properly flushed.</p>
