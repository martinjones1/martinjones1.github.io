<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
