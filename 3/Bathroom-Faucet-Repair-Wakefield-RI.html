<p>Deterioration is a complicated phenomenon and there are many factors that speed up rust in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For many years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it crucial to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that speed up rust Likewise, there is a lack of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient type of deterioration control. Thus, thinking about all these aspects, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that a correctly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
