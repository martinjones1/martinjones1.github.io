<p>Every day, the drains in your home successfully remove big amounts of water and waste. Over time, dirt, debris, hair, and many other small particles can get trapped and build up in your pipes. Eventually, the water may not be able to drain quickly or efficiently, and you may experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is continuously supporting. It might be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to investigate when this takes place.</p>
<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Residences that were built prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how helpful, is an ecological toxin (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have kids, you might not want to reside in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>In most cases, a lack of warm water is triggered by a malfunctioning circuit breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. The dip tube inside the tank may be split if the water is lukewarm. Scalding water is normally the result of a broken pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water is dangerous and must be immediately dealt with by a qualified plumbing professional.</p>
