That odor may be originating from your sewer system, which requires repair right away. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your home, releases sewer gas, and controls air pressure in the waste-system pipes has failed, it will often need to be changed rather than repaired. If your pipes are gurgling or producing nasty odors, you'll understand this.</p>
