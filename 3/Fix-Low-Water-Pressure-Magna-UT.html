<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General. Within the structure envelope consisting of below grade, if less than 10-percent (small) of the existing piping for a sub-system, component, or system  group is replaced, a permit and inspection shall not be required. If so preferred, this shall not preclude the licensee from obtaining licenses and inspections for such work.</p>
