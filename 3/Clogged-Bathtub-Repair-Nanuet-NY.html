<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
