<p>Plumbing is a crucial part of your home or organisation, and its capability to function is essential.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>

By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to provide some type of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're working on installing it.
