<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Most house centers bring only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Continue reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the building; additional, more considerable expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being a problem for locals. A PE or RA can assist determine if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>
<p>Some of the causes of drain line clogs in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a stopping working garbage disposal, or excessive food being gotten rid of down the drain. We will typically recommend our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending upon the intensity of the situation. Offer us a call if your kitchen drain has actually raised water levels, is making gurgling noises, smells foul, or is slow to drain.</p>
