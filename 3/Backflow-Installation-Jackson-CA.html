<p>There are two kinds of products utilized to develop a waste disposal unit unit: aluminum and stainless-steel. The average cost of an aluminum garbage disposal varies from $60 to $150, while a stainless-steel garbage disposal has a typical cost of simply over $150.

To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may want to think about repiping your entire home when you spot a leak.</p>
