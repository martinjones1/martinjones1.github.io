<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Moses Lake WA</h3>
<p>There are a few types of water heaters to choose from, each style has its downsides and advantages. The best one for you depends upon just how much hot water you utilize, and the heating approach (electricity, gas, oil). Some claim to lower energy expenses by as much as 50 percent of traditional storage models. The compromise is that the preliminary costs are higher and your roi will take longer.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers bring only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
