<p>Often you understand you have a sewer line break because you can smell nasty odors or you have a sewage back-up in your house. It is essential to determine the exact location of the break in your sewer line. Oftentimes the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can conserve you thousands of dollars in repairs. Simply sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can solve the problem. The professionals and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you constantly have a copy for your insurance city, real estate agent or company inspector.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this approach, you know the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
