<p>Surprise water leakages are typically difficult and have Possibly Major Repercussions. Replacing your flapper might need somewhat different steps than we reveal (Images 2 and 3).

You may not discover an identical match, but opportunities are you'll find one of the very same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
