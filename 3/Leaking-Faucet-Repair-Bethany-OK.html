Repeating repairs and leakages.

<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler normally are installed in areas where water could trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and areas with electronic equipment.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
