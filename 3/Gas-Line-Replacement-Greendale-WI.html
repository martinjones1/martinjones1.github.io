<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
