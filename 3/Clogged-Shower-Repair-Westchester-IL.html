<p>Once the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from critical locations in the assembly.
