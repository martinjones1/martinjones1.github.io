<p>106.2.1 Repairing Leakages. The stopping of leakages in drains, water, soil, waste or vent pipe, provided that if any concealed trap, drainpipe, water, soil, waste or vent pipe becomes defective and it ends up being essential to eliminate and replace the very same with brand-new material, such work will be considered as new work and an authorization will be acquired and an inspection made as provided in this Code, subject to the provisions set forth in Section 106.2.2.</p>
<p>To identify which toilet valve is causing the problem, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into television, there's an issue with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to drip into the bowl. That slow, constant outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing completely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water spots and rust. But do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
