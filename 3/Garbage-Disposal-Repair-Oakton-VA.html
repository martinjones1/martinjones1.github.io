Throughout regrowth, salted water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean.

When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth instantly begins. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regeneration normally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
