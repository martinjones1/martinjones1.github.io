<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
