<p>The majority of homes or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to rust.

As the external finishing of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>

Construction work not in compliance with code provisions shall be needed to remain exposed up until it has been brought into compliance with the code, been re examined, and been discovered acceptable as finished.</p>
