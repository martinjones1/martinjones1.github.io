<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
