When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can become polluted. If permitted to return to the water supply, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health hazard.
