<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Upper Marlboro MD</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent event, however it does happen regularly than you believe! When you do not see the water was off for a couple of minutes, typically it occurs at night. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction projects easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common cause of backflow. Fire engine use big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
