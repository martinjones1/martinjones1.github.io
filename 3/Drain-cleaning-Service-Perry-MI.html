<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed successful, Sam Blanc developed and constructed a smaller design that operated on the very same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable television. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
<p>When a waste disposal unit breaks, it is probably only a matter of time prior to your sink begins to clog, as you and other home members are probably not used to guaranteeing that no obstructive food waste decreases your drain. Those dissolved solids can trigger a scaly buildup on everything from dishes, to pipes, to the heating aspects of your home appliances, to your own body.

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and identify the cause of the problem. The line was clearly degrading; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line could collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
