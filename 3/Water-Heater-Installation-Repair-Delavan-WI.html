<p>If you're living in an old house that's never been refurbished, you may be handling frequent plumbing problems. Even if you do not have substantial problems, it's wise to repipe your house to secure your property and prevent more considerable concerns in the future.

However, in an effectively working toilet, the water should stop running when the bowl is filled to its suitable capability.
