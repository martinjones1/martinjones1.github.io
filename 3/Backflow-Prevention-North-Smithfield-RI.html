<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>When compared to gas models, electric designs are much easier and more economical to install as electricity is already available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a particular gas line has to be set up and a feasible source of gas established. Another feature of an electric hot water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas models need to be aerated correctly using vents and ducts in order to work properly. With electric models, you will not have to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
