<p>Backflow preventers need to just be repaired when the information collected from the field test indicates the assembly has broken down in its performance listed below the developed minimum standard. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer need to be fixed or if necessary, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
