<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. If enabled to re-enter the water system, there is potential for the infected water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for efficiency, as well as inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
