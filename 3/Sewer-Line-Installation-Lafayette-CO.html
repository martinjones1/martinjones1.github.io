As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a problem-- for its numerous desired usages around your house.</p>
