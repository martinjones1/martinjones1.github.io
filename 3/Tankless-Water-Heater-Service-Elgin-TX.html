<p>When picking the appropriate system protection there are several factors to consider we need to take a look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all situations in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation should be looked at on a specific basis as a special stand-alone system.

Fire security system are designed to match the risk that exists in the locations they are set up in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be really different, we need to understand that the fire security system for any installation needs to be designed and set up to meet that particular risk or need. An airplane garage will need an extremely various fire security system than the system needed in an apartment. The backflow protection requirements for these 2 examples would also differ considerably.</p>
