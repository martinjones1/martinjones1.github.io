<p>Insert the flange on the top side of the sink, and attach the attachment system on the underside (Image 1).

<p>During typical operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of lowered pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is developed to open and release water to the outside if either check valve need to leak. An RPZ will occasionally release small amounts of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ ought to be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and permit adequate drainage.</p>
