Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
