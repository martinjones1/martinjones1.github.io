<p>While UPC does differentiate between commercial and residential systems, its leniency only uses to residential systems using potable water piping materials. In one- and two-family dwellings, AWWA states that backflow preventers are not needed on lawn sprinkler constructed of approved drinkable material and created to stream water, so it doesn't stagnate. Rather, backflow requirements for domestic plumbing might use to those sprinkler systems.</p>
<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which designs are best for specific applications? Typically the type and installation requirements are defined by environmental regulations and local statutes. Local building regulations for instance will need a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air gap between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any possible siphon before it can take place, avoiding contaminating water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more advanced and complicated backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical devices set up to prevent backflow range from the relatively simple to the complex and really sophisticated.</p>
