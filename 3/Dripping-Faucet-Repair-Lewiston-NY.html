<h3>Clear Clogged Toilet in Lewiston New York</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had actually supported into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least 3 attempts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his understanding and experience he figured out that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the freshly cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and persistence the job was done to my complete satisfaction.</p>

<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that regulates water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't installed properly, you may experience an often or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in wasted water.</p>
