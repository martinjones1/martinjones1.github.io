<p>And so, we see the shift from huge transportation pipelines (aqueducts) offering water to entire cities to big circulation pipes (mains) servicing smaller communities or large facilities, to medium circulation pipelines and lastly to small service pipelines. Each stage in the water system and distribution system needs to handle varying circulation rates, flow velocities and pressure heads, together with various levels of exposure to potential backwash or pollutant seepage and the subsequent need for defense with backflow preventers.</p>

<p>Sewer lines can stop working for a variety of reasons, including poor soil conditions, clogs from grease and grime, and corrosion. Even trees and bushes can trigger problems for sewer lines, specifically in older areas where clay pipe might have been used. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as compounded if pipes have been allowed to freeze.</p>
<p>Some water heater problems are small adequate to be successfully addressed with professional repairs. Things like an unlit pilot light, tripped breaker, broken burner, or sediment buildup are all easy and relatively low-cost to attend to. Nevertheless, particular problems with your hot water heater may suggest that it's time for a replacement. Our Wheaton plumbers can help you identify which course of action is best for you.</p>
