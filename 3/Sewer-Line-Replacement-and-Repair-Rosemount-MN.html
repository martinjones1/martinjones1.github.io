<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
