<p>The repair professional should have the ability to recognize the many various manufacturers and the specific designs produced throughout the years. Some models might appear comparable on the outside but could need different repair parts on the inside, so the repair professional should have the ability to identify the make, design and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that might have been produced. In some cases the identification number of the assembly will be required to distinguish one model from another. It is important to know the proper design to ensure you get the correct repair parts.</p>
<p>The system has actually gone back to a no demand condition (no valves open downstream). Nevertheless, debris between the # 1 Inspect Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the parts, is avoiding the # 1 Inspect from closing all the way. This enables pressure to equalize in between the Supply Side and the Zone of Minimized Pressure. When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
