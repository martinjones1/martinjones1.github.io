<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it includes. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is usually utilized in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>
