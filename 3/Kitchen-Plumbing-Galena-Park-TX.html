<p>Property owners can ask for a plumbing inspection at any time, however it is specifically prudent to organize inspections on a yearly basis and when purchasing a new house.

<p>New designs of waste disposal unit might need to be hard-wired into a dedicated electrical circuit from the electrical panel; if this isn't available in an older home, working with an electrical contractor to include a circuit costs around $150-$ 250. The drain line is clogged: If your kitchen sink blockages, never ever use chemical drain cleaner! Rather, call a plumber to locate and clear the clog without damaging your garbage disposal.</p>
