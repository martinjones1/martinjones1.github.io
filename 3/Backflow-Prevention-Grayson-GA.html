So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers manage all kinds of work. Their tasks break out into two categories: Plumbers who manage standard repairs (often in emergency scenarios), and plumbers who focus on remodeling additions and jobs.</p>

<p>To prep your system for installation, you might need to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug kit that I bought individually from the disposal unit. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
