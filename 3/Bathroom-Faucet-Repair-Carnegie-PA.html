While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a nuisance-- for its numerous desired usages around your home.</p>

This difference in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water flows in the regular direction.</p>
