<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
