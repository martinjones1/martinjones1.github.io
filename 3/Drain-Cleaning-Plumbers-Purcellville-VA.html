<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are many aspects that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that speed up corrosion Also, there is an absence of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable type of corrosion control. Hence, thinking about all these factors, in addition to arise from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
