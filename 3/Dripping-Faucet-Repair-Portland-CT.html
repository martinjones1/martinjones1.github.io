The metal pipes are galvanized steel or iron, brass, and copper. The plastic pipes are Poly Vinyl Chloride PVC, Chlorine Poly Vinyl Chloride CPVC, Poly Ethylene PE, Polybutylene PB, and Kitec. Most of these plastic pipe systems will end in lawsuits. Part of the problem is with the fittings that are frequently inexpensively made with little quality control by a verity of overseas companies.
