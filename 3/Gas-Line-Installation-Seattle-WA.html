<h3>Discover Why Plumbing Services Are Expensive Seattle WA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these problems.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were really responsive and timely to send me a bid which was really competitive. They were really professional and did an awesome task. I would definitely call them once again for my plumbing requires. Now, if this staining only appears when warm water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is obviously still an issue that requires to be dealt with right away (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) however not one that needs repiping.</p>
