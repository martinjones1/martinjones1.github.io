<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. A reaction crew is readily available for preliminary examination of sewer emergencies every day of the year. Call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance staff at (503) 823-1700 if sewage from the City-maintained part of the sewer system backs up through sinks or toilets. City workers will check and get rid of obstructions in the mainline sewer and the part of the service line that the City is accountable for.

<p>Improperly set up gas lines lead to gas leaks. Gas leaks are costly to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself job. The gas lines need to be adjusted to the best levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy says that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the 2nd highest energy consuming area of a house, next to heating & cooling. The amount of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic tank from your house. When you experience blockages in several drains at the same time in your home, then that typically implies that your main sewer line is supporting. This can take place in multiple locations and any combination of drains. For example, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from several drain lines in your house.</p>
