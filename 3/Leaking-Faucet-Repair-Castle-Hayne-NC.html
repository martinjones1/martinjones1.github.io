Additionally, rust or other accumulations in the pipes can limit airflow and make it impossible to use several of your gas-powered appliances like the clothing dryer or stove. Based upon research conducted by the Water Quality Association (WQA) Water Softener Advantages Study, 2011.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a serious public health risk if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies installed.

Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. There is capacity for the polluted water to end up being a health threat if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for effectiveness, as well as examined every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
