<p>The next action we should carry out in the repair procedure, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have cleaned the body, and the repaired parts are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be challenging, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system needs to be utilized to assure the line is properly flushed.</p>
