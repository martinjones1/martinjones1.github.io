<p>Day to day usage must not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also happen if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a stable and safe location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you need to wait until after the cycle is finished and then inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings. You must also examine to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

<p>When lime is added to the water, it changes the water chemistry, triggering the calcium to come out of the solution. The particles of calcium combine, become much heavier than the rest of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins.
