<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Carlisle PA</h3>
<p>Marin WATER is a professional plumbing and water treatment professional situated in San Rafael, CA. We proudly serve residential and commercial customers throughout Marin County, California. Does your water taste bad? Does it leave a chalky residue on your components and counters? No matter what problems you're having with your tap water, RainSoft has the ideal service.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
