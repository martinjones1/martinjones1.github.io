<p>What is difficult water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a problem-- for its numerous intended uses around your house.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems utilize UV light to destroy micro-organisms and supply cleansed water.
