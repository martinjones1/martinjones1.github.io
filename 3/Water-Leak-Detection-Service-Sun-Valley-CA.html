<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually typically been misunderstood as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due mostly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening merely removes solidity minerals and removes problems that are a problem and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not need. However, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this choice a considerable one.</p>
