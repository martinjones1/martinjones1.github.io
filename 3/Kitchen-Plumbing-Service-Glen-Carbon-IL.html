When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that only original factory repair parts are utilized.

<p>To figure out which toilet valve is triggering the difficulty, take a look at the overflow tube. There's an issue with the toilet fill valve if water is overflowing into the tube.

That slow, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing completely. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water spots and rust. But don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
