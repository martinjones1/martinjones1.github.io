<p>Water softeners are appliances linked to your house's water supply that eliminate the minerals like calcium and magnesium that trigger water solidity. Water softening equipment can be easily eliminated, so you can take it with you if you move. Your plumbing system is a complex labyrinth of pipes going through your walls, ceilings, and floorings to get water to all of your various components and devices. If you choose to renovate your home, you may need to add pipes.</p>
<p>Does it seem like your drains are constantly sluggish or clogged? Often, this is triggered by built-up sediment and other products that are triggering a clog in your sewer drain. Where other drain cleaning and plumbing companies will attempt to charge you an arm and a leg to collect and clean your sewer line, Northwest Drain Station provides hydro jetting, an extremely reliable solution for removing stubborn products that have stayed with the walls of your pipeline, restoring a healthy circulation to your drains.</p>
<p>Water softeners, like the CareSoft Pro, work by removing an abundance of calcium and magnesium from water. Sediment from these components not just dry your skin and hair but also build up in home appliances and pipes reducing their efficiency and life span. Your washing machine, dishwasher and water heater are all negatively affected by difficult water. The results of hard water can be seen on your dishes, the color and softness of your clothing, the film on your shower door and even your personal look and convenience.</p>
