<p>Garbage disposals are an essential feature in any modern-day kitchen. If you live in an older home, your sink may not have one, forcing you to be diligent about keeping food scraps from flowing down the drain. It's also possible for a disposal to suddenly break, bringing cooking or cleanup to a grinding halt. Copper pipes = $1.50-$ 2.00 per direct foot. Copper pipes are environmentally friendly and are resistant to breaking.

Both will produce an excellent seal (though the gasket might result in percentages of water collecting around the flange), and what's used is largely a matter of choice. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's harder to remove.</p>
