Most homes in the United States, consisting of Tampa Bay Area, have what is referred to as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets also have a flapper seal made from rubber at the bottom of the tank that keeps the water in the tank until the toilet is flushed.  This seal degrades in time allowing water to get away into the toilet bowl, hence minimizing the amount of water in the tank offered for a flush.  It also has the drawback of increasing your water costs due to wastage of water.</p>
<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that regulates water circulation in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't installed properly, you might experience a regularly or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>
