<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber Florence AZ</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
