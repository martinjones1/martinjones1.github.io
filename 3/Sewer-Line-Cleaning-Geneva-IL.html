<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
