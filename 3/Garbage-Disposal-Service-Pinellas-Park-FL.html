Our skilled repair group integrates our years of know-how with state-of-the-art tools and technology to manage toilet repairs large and little across all of San Diego.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Most house centers carry just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>The drains in the average house get constant usage. Hair, food scraps, soap scum, and other debris can slowly build up over time. The drain will slowly slow up until it ends up being totally clogged. Chemical drain cleaners sold in stores have limited effectiveness. Although the drain may seem to clear initially, the outcome is typically temporary and the clog quickly returns. Utilizing these chemicals regularly can trigger damage to your plumbing pipes.</p>
<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer calculates the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regeneration usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
