<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
