Toilets also have a flapper seal made of rubber at the bottom of the cistern that keeps the water in the tank up until the toilet is flushed.  This seal degrades over time enabling water to leave into the toilet bowl, hence reducing the quantity of water in the tank readily available for a flush.  It also has the downside of increasing your water expense due to waste of water.</p>
