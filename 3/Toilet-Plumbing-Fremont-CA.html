<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is typical in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
