Warning: some plumbers set up stub outs" of copper when exiting the wall. Even if copper is revealing does not mean you do not have polybutylene pipes. You might have to make a little hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>Solar water heaters: These economical and eco-friendly heaters draw energy from the sun to heat water. They require no electrical energy or gas and can decrease your costs by an approximated 14 to 18%.

<p>Sometimes you understand you have a sewer line break since you can smell nasty odors or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is essential to determine the specific location of the break in your sewer line. Many times the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can conserve you thousands of dollars in repairs. Merely sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can fix the issue. The specialists and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you constantly have a copy for your insurance company, city or real estate agent inspector.</p>
<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current dual flush HET used by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We recommend, as the majority of plumbers do, to use disposals moderately. Correct care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its guarantee and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
