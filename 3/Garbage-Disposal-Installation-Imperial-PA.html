<p>The next step we should carry out in the repair procedure, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have actually cleaned the body, and the fixed components are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be tricky, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be used to ensure the line is effectively flushed.</p>
