The average cost to install a gas line for a kitchen stove is $15 to $25 per direct foot. Overall expenses vary from $200 to $1,000 or more depending upon the length of piping required to connect to the main gas supply, which typically averages 30'.</p>
<p>A lot of softeners have actually a bypass constructed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to offer some type of maintenance to it and even while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's wise to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to keep the unit.</p>
