<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â² hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
