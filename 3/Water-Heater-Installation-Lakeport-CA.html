<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing procedure consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive product. Some disposer units do not featured a power cable attached. Eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1) if this is the case. Be sure to purchase a wiring kit with the appropriate power rating and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). When you link the circuitry harness to the disposer, make sure the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cord.</p>
<p>Professional installers utilize internal pipe finish to repair an existing sewer pipe that has begun to leak into surrounding soil.
