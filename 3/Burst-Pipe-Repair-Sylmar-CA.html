<p>The space under your kitchen sink has gotten more congested over the years.

<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler normally are installed in areas where water could trigger catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

Through a procedure called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
