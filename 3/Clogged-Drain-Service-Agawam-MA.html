<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the first most apparent indications of a sewer concern is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic issue such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a bigger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent severe damage to your home.

That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can attain this.</p>
