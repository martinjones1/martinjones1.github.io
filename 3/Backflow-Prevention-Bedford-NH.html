<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed effective, Sam Blanc developed and built a smaller design that operated on the exact same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also constructed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable television. It was ceased in 1973.</p>

<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the needed instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. There is capacity for the polluted water to become a health hazard if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for effectiveness, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
