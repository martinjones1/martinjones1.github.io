<p>When the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important areas in the assembly.
