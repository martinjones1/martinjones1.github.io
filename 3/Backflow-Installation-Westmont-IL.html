Easements (usually 10 feet large) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>

<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Westmont IL</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system should be continually monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
