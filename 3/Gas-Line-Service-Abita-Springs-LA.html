<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
