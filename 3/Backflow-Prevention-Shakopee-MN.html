<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the glory in the toilet world, but the journey lever is the bridge in between male and machine.

And who wishes to do all that work??? In all seriousness however, making sure your journey lever is working well can conserve you the inconvenience of those little day-to-day inconveniences - that many people simply deal with and never ever recognize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to discuss the gallons of water squandered every day by a poor seal.</p>
