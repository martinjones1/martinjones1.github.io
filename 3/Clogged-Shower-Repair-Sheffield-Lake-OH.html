When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

Describe makers flow curves to identify optimal discharge rate based on supply pressure or on-site pressure; whichever is greater.
