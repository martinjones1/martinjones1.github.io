<p>Domestic water that arrives to your Ohio home carries minerals that can trigger rust on metal parts and elements. To prevent deterioration from rust, storage tanks are geared up with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by bring in damaging products. By having the anode rod inspected routinely and changed as needed, you can double the life of your hot water heater.</p>
<p>When it comes to plumbing and maintenance, sewer video inspection is amongst the best ways to stay ahead of the game.

The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm guarantee that the unique function will not stop working. Depending upon the water source, you may have to filter turbid water or decontaminate bacteria-laden water-all prior to it even reaches the softening system. Finally, if you own a septic tank, you need to think about the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regeneration.

It's important to go out in front of any problems as fast as possible. The quicker you respond to a concern, the better opportunity you'll need to save money and time on water heater services.</p>
