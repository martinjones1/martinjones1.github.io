<p>As a locally-owned company, integrity and responsibility are incredibly important to building a track record for excellence. One typical way for a house's water supply to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which could become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that infected water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the issue could spread out exponentially. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in individual houses, it also avoids wastewater in private houses from receding out and polluting the general public water supply.</p>

<p>When pipes are set up into a vertical type it is referred to as a hydrostatic loop. In this configuration the loop should be higher than 33 feet to work properly. When developed this way it avoids siphoning and backflow into a water supply. Plumb Crazy Plumbing offers a basic one month warranty on repairs, drain cleaning and 1 year warranty on replacement plumbing jobs.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers need to only be repaired when the information gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has broken down in its efficiency below the developed minimum basic. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if essential, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This implies the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
