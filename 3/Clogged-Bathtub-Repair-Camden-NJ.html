<p>Many homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system.

As the outer covering of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>So, if you want to stop having to jerk your toilet handle each time you flush and are fed up of publishing courteous signs in your bathroom everytime you have individuals over, get a new trip lever that actually works for your toilet.
