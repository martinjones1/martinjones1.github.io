Beyond this kind of repair, you need to know when to call in a pro. Plumbing isn't difficult, however it needs a lot of knowledge. Code requirements are just a small part; you also need parts knowledge and experience with the materials.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
