This can cause low flow concerns or even stop a fixture from streaming completely. The next common problem that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which happens when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it lowers the offered volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
<p>We had a fantastic experience with Joe Boyette, he was very professional, courteous, qualified. We had a great deal of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month duration. We also needed to replace a water and a bathroom heater unrelated to the fire, but we felt confident in Joe's capabilities. We made the decision to stay with Joe, even though we felt Mr Rooter costs were absolutely on the high-end. This being published by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>
