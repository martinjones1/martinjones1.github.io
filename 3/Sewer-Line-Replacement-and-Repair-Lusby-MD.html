If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
