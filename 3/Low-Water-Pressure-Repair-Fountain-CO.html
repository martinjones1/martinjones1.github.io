<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
