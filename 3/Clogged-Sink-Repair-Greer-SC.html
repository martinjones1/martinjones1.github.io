<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
