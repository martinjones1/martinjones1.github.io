<h3>Water Softeners & Filters in Rutherford New Jersey</h2>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
