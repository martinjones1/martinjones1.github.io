<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Madera CA</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
