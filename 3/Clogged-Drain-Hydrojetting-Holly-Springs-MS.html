<p>In many cases, our technicians will suggest that you replace your hot water heater instead of buy repairs.

In some cases a troublesome toilet just requires a small modification and life is back to regular. That is why we offer a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) change the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) perform a dye test.</p>

It's a low-cost and simple  way to help keep things in excellent working order.</p>

<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Holly Springs MS?</h3>
<p>Older plumbing systems may have pipes that corrode with time, causing leakages or other problems. Additionally, rust or other accumulations in the pipes can limit air flow and make it difficult to use one or more of your gas-powered appliances like the clothes dryer or stove. Based on research study conducted by the Water Quality Association (WQA) Water Softener Benefits Study, 2011.</p>
<p>However, you also need to consider the age of your unit. If your system is getting near 10 years old, it's usually not a good idea to pay for repairs if they deserve more than 50 percent of the cost of a brand-new system. If problems become more frequent with an older system, then it is recommended that you have the waste disposal unit changed. We offer a number of extremely effective and affordable systems, and offer upfront prices before work starts so there are not a surprises. It is our goal to provide all of our valued customers throughout Albuquerque and the surrounding areas the service they need at a cost they can manage.</p>
<p>The drains in the average home get continuous usage. Hair, food scraps, soap residue, and other particles can gradually build up over time. The drain will slowly slow up until it ends up being totally clogged. Chemical drain cleaners sold in stores have restricted efficiency. Although the drain may seem to clear initially, the result is often short-term and the clog quickly returns. Using these chemicals frequently can trigger damage to your plumbing pipes.</p>
<p>Call a plumber: If the clog is not in the P-trap and water streams easily from the sink drain into your container, then it's time to call a plumber The clog is likely further down the line. Leaking sewer lines inside your home can damage floors, carpentry, and other valuable objects such as cabinets. Left unattended, leaking sewer water can lead to mold and far more major structural damage. If neglected, leaking sewer water from your main house drain or home sewer can also cause substantial damage.</p>
