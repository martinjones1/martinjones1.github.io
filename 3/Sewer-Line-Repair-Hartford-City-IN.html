<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>This is the classic concern that lots of house owners ask themselves. Is it much better to repair their pipes or repipe them and begin fresh? The answer is totally depending on your distinct circumstance. For instance, if your pipe is experiencing a little leak but remains in otherwise good condition, we would advise fixing it. However, if the pipe is constantly leaking and needs frequent repairs, we would advise repiping.
