Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with.

<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Kissimmee FL</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention safeguards safe and clean water supply from prospective dangers. There are over 10,000 reported cases of backflow contamination each year.
