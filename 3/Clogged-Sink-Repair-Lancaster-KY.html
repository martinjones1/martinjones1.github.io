When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your home.

Salt is generally used in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>

For this reason, the RPZ ought to be installed in areas that are exempt to water damage and enable adequate drainage.</p>
