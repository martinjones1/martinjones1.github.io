<p>Leaks are tricky. Drains clog with time. In cooking areas, greases, soaps and more build up on the walls of the pipes and trigger a clog. In bathrooms, showers, tubs and sinks ended up being clogged with hair and soap, and toilets can become clogged with toilet tissue. You need the help of a plumber experienced in drain cleaning when this occurs.

<p>Action 6: To connect the drain, place the gasket in the discharge outlet. Then attach the discharge tube with the flange and bolts. Now hang the disposal by lining up the 3 tabs with the installing ring. Use the included wrench to turn and lock the tabs over the ridges. Then connect the dishwasher drain. Make sure the discharge pipe is lined up effectively and connect your drains-- use a T-pipe prior to your P-trap.</p>
