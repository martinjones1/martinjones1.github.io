<p>Sometimes you know you have a sewer line break since you can smell foul odors or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is necessary to identify the precise area of the break in your sewer line. Often times the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and understanding this can save you thousands of dollars in repairs. Merely sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can fix the issue. The service technicians and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you constantly have a copy for your insurance city, real estate agent or company inspector.</p>

At the least, it would have been a very pricey alternative.</p>
