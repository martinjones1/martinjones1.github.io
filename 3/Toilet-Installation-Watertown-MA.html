<p>Next, test the flapper as displayed in Photo 1. Water is most likely escaping through a split or rusted overflow tube if extra pressure on the flapper does not stop the running noise. Because case, you have to detach the tank from the bowl and replace the whole flush valve. Because the overflow tube is rarely the cause of a running toilet, we will not cover that repair here.</p>

<p>Does it seem like your drains are always sluggish or clogged? Frequently, this is triggered by built-up sediment and other products that are triggering a blockage in your sewer drain. Where other drain cleaning and plumbing companies will try to charge you a leg and an arm to collect and clean your sewer line, Northwest Drain Station offers hydro jetting, an extremely effective solution for dislodging stubborn products that have stuck to the walls of your pipeline, bring back a healthy circulation to your drains.</p>
<p>New houses built with copper pipes are especially vulnerable to corrosive water conditions because the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to end up being layered within. As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a period of three to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Lots of new homes are built with PEX and not copper.</p>
