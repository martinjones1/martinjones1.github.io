<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. A response team is readily available for preliminary examination of sewer emergencies every day of the year. If sewage from the City-maintained portion of the sewer system backs up through toilets or sinks, call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance personnel at (503) 823-1700. City workers will check and remove blockages in the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line that the City is accountable for. If the problem is the outcome of too much storm water in the system, you might need to wait till the storm has actually subsided to have the backup solved.</p>
<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General. Within the structure envelope consisting of listed below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a sub-system, system, or fixture  group is replaced, a license and inspection will not be needed. This shall not prevent the licensee from getting permits and inspections for such work if so desired.</p>
<p>You'll observe that water runs to refill the bowl Whenever you flush your toilet. However, in an appropriately working toilet, the water ought to stop running when the bowl is filled to its proper capacity. Possibilities are you have an internal leak and water is being disposed down the overflow if your toilet continues to run. These leaks are incredibly inefficient, as more than a hundred gallons of water wind up taking a trip through the overflow.</p>
<p>You reside in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever replaced its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are known to burst and rust when they get old. You might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one if so. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
