<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
