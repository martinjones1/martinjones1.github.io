I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a considerable clog that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole.
