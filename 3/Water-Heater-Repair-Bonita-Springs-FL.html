<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct effect on your security, benefit, convenience, and reliability than your plumbing system. This is very crucial! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to press the waste out of your drain system. Existing regulations restrict the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We provide two types of water treatment systems for difficult water: Benefit Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
<p>You also need to buy a backflow valve if you see your water has an unusual circulation, odor, color or taste.
