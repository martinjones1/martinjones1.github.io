Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a regular event, however it does occur more often than you believe! When you don't discover the water was off for a few minutes, frequently it happens at night. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding areas.</p>
