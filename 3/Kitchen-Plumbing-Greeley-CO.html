<p>This is an entirely legitimate question that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, of course, as important as your hot water heater, water line, or drains. Nonetheless, it includes a fair amount of performance to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a reasonably small cylindrical device set up under the kitchen drain.

Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly flow into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>With three options for dealing with a fresh water leak under the slab, a complete repipe is often the very best choice. Considering the place of the leak, the condition of the slab, and the advancement the home is located in are all important elements when making the decision to repipe, versus fixing or rerouting. When your house is impacted by a slab leak, Kenz plumbing has the experience to direct you in the right instructions.</p>
